Anyone who has your key can use your VSC account! Details on connecting to the HPC infrastructure are available in Chapter 3 of the HPC manual . Getting help # To get help: use the documentation available on the system, through the help , info and man commands (use q to exit). help cd info ls man cp use Google contact hpc@ugent.be in case of problems or questions (even for basic things!)

Basic terminal usage # The basic interface is the so-called shell prompt, typically ending with $ (for bash shells). You use the shell by executing commands, and hitting <enter> . For example: $ echo hello hello You can go to the start or end of the command line using Ctrl-A or Ctrl-E . To go through previous commands, use <up> and <down> , rather than retyping them. Command history # A powerful feature is that you can \"search\" through your command history, either using the history command, or using Ctrl-R : $ history 1 echo hello # hit Ctrl-R, type 'echo' (reverse-i-search)`echo': echo hello Stopping commands # If for any reason you want to stop a command from executing, press Ctrl-C . For example, if a command is taking too long, or you want to rerun it with different arguments. Variables # At the prompt we also have access to shell variables, which have both a name and a value . They can be thought of as placeholders for things we need to remember. For example, to print the path to your home directory, we can use the shell variable named HOME : $ echo $HOME /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 This prints the value of this variable. Defining variables # There are several variables already defined for you when you start your session, such as $HOME which contains the path to your home directory. For a full overview of defined environment variables in your current session, you can use the env command. You can sort this output with sort to make it easier to search in: $ env | sort ... HOME=/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 ... You can also use the grep command to search for a piece of text. The following command will output all VSC-specific variable names and their values: $ env | sort | grep VSC But we can also define our own. this is done with the export command (note: variables are always all-caps as a convention): $ export MYVARIABLE=\"value\" It is important you don't include spaces around the = sign. Also note the lack of $ sign in front of the variable name. If we then do $ echo $MYVARIABLE this will output value . Note that the quotes are not included, they were only used when defining the variable to escape potential spaces in the value. Changing your prompt using $PS1 # You can change what your prompt looks like by redefining the special-purpose variable $PS1 . For example: to include the current location in your prompt: $ export PS1='\\w $' ~ $ cd test ~/test $ Note that ~ is short representation of your home directory. To make this persistent across session, you can define this custom value for $PS1 in your .profile startup script: $ echo 'export PS1=\"\\w $ \" ' >> ~/.profile Using non-defined variables # One common pitfall is the (accidental) use of non-defined variables. Contrary to what you may expect, this does not result in error messages, but the variable is considered to be empty instead. This may lead to surprising results, for example: $ export WORKDIR=/tmp/test $ pwd /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 $ echo $HOME /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 To understand what's going on here, see the section on cd below. The moral here is: be very careful to not use empty variables unintentionally . Tip for job scripts: use set -e -u to avoid using empty variables accidentally. The -e option will result in the script getting stopped if any command fails. The -u option will result in the script getting stopped if empty variables are used.

Input/output # To redirect output to files, you can use the redirection operators: > , >> , &> , and < . First, it's important to make a distinction between two different output channels: stdout : standard output channel, for regular output stderr : standard error channel, for errors and warnings Redirecting stdout # > writes the ( stdout ) output of a command to a file and overwrites whatever was in the file before. $ echo hello > somefile $ cat somefile hello $ echo hello2 > somefile $ cat somefile hello2 >> appends the ( stdout ) output of a command to a file; it does not clobber whatever was in the file before: $ echo hello > somefile $ cat somefile hello $ echo hello2 >> somefile $ cat somefile hello hello2 Reading from stdin # < reads a file from standard input (piped or typed input). So you would use this to simulate typing into a terminal. < somefile.txt is largely equivalent to cat somefile.txt | . One common use might be to take the results of a long-running command and store the results in a file, so you don't have to repeat it while you refine your command line. For example, if you have a large directory structure you might save a list of all the files you're interested in and then reading in the file list when you are done: $ find . -name .txt > files $ xargs grep banana < files Redirecting stderr # To redirect the stderr output (warnings, messages), you can use 2> , just like > $ ls one.txt nosuchfile.txt 2> errors.txt one.txt $ cat errors.txt ls: nosuchfile.txt: No such file or directory Combining stdout and stderr # To combine both output channels ( stdout and stderr ) and redirect them to a single file, you can use &> $ ls one.txt nosuchfile.txt &> ls.out $ cat ls.out ls: nosuchfile.txt: No such file or directory one.txt Command piping # Part of the power of the command line is to string multiple commands together to create useful results. The core of these is the pipe: | . For example, to see the number of files in a directory, we can pipe the ( stdout ) output of ls to wc ( w ord c ount, but can also be used to count the number of lines with the -l flag). $ ls | wc -l 42 A common pattern is to pipe the output of a command to less so you can examine or search the output: $ find . | less Or to look through your command history: $ history | less You can put multiple pipes in the same line. For example, which cp commands have we run? $ history | grep cp | less Shell expansion # The shell will expand certain things, including: * wildcard: for example ls t*txt will list all files starting with 't' and ending in 'txt' tab completion: hit the <tab> key to make the shell complete your command line; works for completing file names, command names, etc. $... or ${...} : environment variables will be replaced with their value; example: echo \"I am $USER\" or echo \"I am ${USER}\" square brackets can be used to list a number of options for a particular characters; example: ls *.[oe][0-9] . This will list all files starting with whatever characters ( * ), then a dot ( . ), then either an 'o' or an 'e' ( [oe] ), then a character from '0' to '9' (so any digit) ( [0-9] ). So this filename will match: anything.o5 , but this one won't: anything.o52 . Process information # ps and pstree # ps lists processes running. By default, it will only show you the processes running in the local shell. To see all of your processes running on the system, use: $ ps -fu $USER To see all the processes: $ ps -elf To see all the processes in a forest view, use: $ ps auxf The last two will spit out a lot of data, so get in the habit of piping it to less . pstree is another way to dump a tree/forest view. It looks better than ps auxf but it has much less information so its value is limited. pgrep will find all the processes where the name matches the pattern and print the process IDs (PID). This is used in piping the processes together as we will see in the next section. kill # ps isn't very useful unless you can manipulate the processes. We do this using the kill command. Kill will send a message ( SIGINT ) to the process to ask it to stop. $ kill 1234 $ kill $(pgrep misbehaving_process) Usually, this ends the process, giving it the opportunity to flush data to files, etc. However, if the process ignored your signal, you can send it a different message ( SIGKILL ) which the OS will use to unceremoniously terminate the process: $ kill -9 1234 top # top is a tool to see the current status of the system. You've probably used something similar in Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor in macOS. top will update every second and has a few interesting commands. To see only your processes, type u and your username after starting top , (you can also do this with top -u $USER ). The default is to sort the display by %CPU . To change the sort order, use < and > like arrow keys. There are a lot of configuration options in top , but if you're interested in seeing a nicer view, you can run htop instead. Be aware that it's not installed everywhere, while top is. To exit top , use q (for 'quit'). For more information, see Brendan Gregg's excellent site dedicated to performance analysis . ulimit # ulimit is a utility to get or set user limits on the machine. For example, you may be limited to a certain number of processes. To see all the limits that have been set, use: $ ulimit -a Counting: wc # To count the number of lines, words, and characters (or bytes) in a file, use wc ( w ord ount): $ wc example.txt 90 468 3189 example.txt The output indicates that the file named example.txt contains 90 lines, 468 words, and 3189 characters/bytes. To only count the number of lines, use wc -l : $ wc -l example.txt 90 example.txt Searching file contents: grep # grep is an important command. It was originally an abbreviation for \"globally search a regular expression and print\" but it's entered the common computing lexicon and people use 'grep' to mean searching for anything. To use grep, you give a pattern and a list of files. $ grep banana fruit.txt $ grep banana fruit_bowl1.txt fruit_bowl2.txt $ grep banana fruit*txt grep also lets you search for Regular Expressions , but these are not in scope for this introductory text. cut # cut is used to pull fields out of files or pipes streams. It's a useful glue when you mix it with grep because grep can find the lines where a string occurs and cut can pull out a particular field. For example, to pull the first column ( -f 1 , the first f ield) from (an unquoted) CSV (comma-separated values, so -d ',' : d elimited by , ) file, you can use the following: $ cut -f 1 -d ',' mydata.csv sed # sed is the stream editor. It is used to replace text in a file or piped stream. In this way, it works like grep, but instead of just searching, it can also edit files. This is like \"Search and Replace\" in a text editor. sed has a lot of features, but almost everyone uses the extremely basic version of string replacement: $ sed 's/oldtext/newtext/g' myfile.txt By default, sed will just print the results. If you want to edit the file inplace, use -i , but be very careful that the results will be what you want before you go around destroying your data ! awk # awk is a basic language that builds on sed to do much more advanced stream editing. Going in depth is far out of scope of this tutorial, but there are two examples that are worth knowing. First, cut is very limited in pulling fields apart based on whitespace. For example, if you have padded fields then cut -f 4 -d ' ' will almost certainly give you a headache as there might be an uncertain number of spaces between each field. awk does better whitespace splitting. So, pulling out the fourth field in a whitespace delimited file is as follows: $ awk '{print $4}' mydata.dat You can use -F ':' to change the delimiter (F for field separator). The next example is used to sum numbers from a field: $ awk -F ',' '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' mydata.csv Basic Shell Scripting # The basic premise of a script is to execute automate the execution of multiple commands. If you find yourself repeating the same commands over and over again, you should consider writing one script to do the same. A script is nothing special, it is just a text file like any other. Any commands you put in there will be executed from the top to bottom. However, there are some rules you need to abide by. Here is a very detailed guide should you need more information. Shebang # The first line of the script is the so-called shebang ( # is sometimes called hash and ! is sometimes called bang). This line tells the shell which command should execute the script. In most cases, this will simply be the shell itself. The line itself looks a bit weird, but you can copy-paste this line as you need not worry about it further. It is however very important this is the very first line of the script! These are all valid shebangs, but you should only use one of them: #!/bin/sh #!/bin/bash #!/usr/bin/env bash Conditionals # Sometimes you only want certain commands to be executed when a certain condition is met. For example, only move files to a directory if that directory exists. The syntax: if [ -d directory ] && [ -f file ] then mv file directory fi Or you only want to do something if a file exists: if [ -f filename ] then echo \"it exists\" fi Or only if a certain variable is bigger than one: if [ $AMOUNT -gt 1 ] then echo \"More than one\" # more commands fi Several pitfalls exist with this syntax. You need spaces surrounding the brackets, the then needs to be at the beginning of a line. It is best to just copy this example and modify it. In the initial example, we used -d to test if a directory existed. There are several more checks . Another useful example, is to test if a variable contains a value (so it's not empty): if [ -z $PBS_ARRAYID ] then echo \"Not an array job, quitting.\" exit 1 fi the -z will check if the length of the variable's value is greater than zero. Loops # Are you copy-pasting commands? Are you doing the same thing with just different options? You most likely can simplify your script by using a loop. Let's look at a simple example: for i in 1 2 3 do echo $i done Subcommands # Subcommands are used all the time in shell scripts. What they do is storing the output of a command in a variable. So this can later be used in a conditional or a loop for example. CURRENTDIR=`pwd` # using backticks CURRENTDIR=$(pwd) # recommended (easier to type) In the above example you can see the 2 different methods of using a subcommand. pwd will output the current working directory, and its output will be stored in the CURRENTDIR variable. The recommended way to use subcommands is with the $() syntax. Errors # Sometimes some things go wrong and a command or script you ran causes an error. How do you properly deal with these situations? Firstly a useful thing to know for debugging and testing is that you can run any command like this: command 2>&1 output.log # one single output file, both output and errors If you add 2>&1 output.log at the end of any command, it will combine stdout and stderr , outputting it into a single file named output.log . If you want regular and error output separated you can use: command > output.log 2> output.err # errors in a separate file this will write regular output to output.log and error output to output.err . You can then look for the errors with less or search for specific text with grep . In scripts, you can use: set -e This will tell the shell to stop executing any subsequent commands when a single command in the script fails. This is most convenient as most likely this causes the rest of the script to fail as well. Advanced error checking # Sometimes you want to control all the error checking yourself, this is also possible. Everytime you run a command, a special variable $? is used to denote successful completion of the command. A value other than zero signifies something went wrong. So an example use case: command_with_possible_error exit_code = $? # capture exit code of last command if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ] then echo \"something went wrong\" fi .bashrc login script # If you have certain commands executed every time you log in (which includes every time a job starts), you can add them to your $HOME/.bashrc file. This file is a shell script that gets executed every time you log in. Examples include: modifying your $PS1 (to tweak your shell prompt) printing information about the current/jobs environment (echoing environment variables, etc.) selecting a specific cluster to run on with module swap cluster/... Some recommendations: Avoid using module load statements in your $HOME/.bashrc file Don't directly edit your .bashrc file: if there's an error in your .bashrc file, you might not be able to log in again. To prevent that, use another file to test your changes, then copy them over when you tested the script. Scripting for the cluster # When writing scripts to be submitted on the cluster there are some tricks you need to keep in mind. Example job script # #!/bin/bash #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1 #PBS -N FreeSurfer_per_subject-time-longitudinal #PBS -l walltime=48:00:00 #PBS -q long #PBS -m abe #PBS -j oe export DATADIR = $VSC_DATA /example # $PBS_JOBID is unique for each job, so this creates a unique directory export WORKDIR = $VSC_SCRATCH_NODE / $PBS_JOBID mkdir -p $WORKDIR # copy files to local storage cp -a $DATADIR /workfiles $WORKDIR / # load software we need module load FreeSurfer cd $WORKDIR # recon-all ... &> output.log # this command takes too long, let's show a more practical example echo $PBS_ARRAYID > $WORKDIR / $PBS_ARRAYID .txt # create results directory if necessary mkdir -p $DATADIR /results # copy work files back cp $WORKDIR / $PBS_ARRAYID .txt $DATADIR /results/ PBS pragmas # The scheduler needs to know about the requirements of the script, for example: how much memory will it use, and how long will it run. These things can be specified inside a script with what we call PBS pragmas. This pragma (a pragma is a special comment) tells PBS to use 1 node and core : #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1 # single-core For parallel software, you can request multiple cores (OpenMP) and/or multiple nodes ( MPI ). Only use this when the software you use is capable of working in parallel . Here is an example: #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=16 # single-node, multi-core #PBS -l nodes=5:ppn=16 # multi-node We intend to submit it on the long queue : #PBS -q long We request a total running time of 48 hours (2 days). #PBS -l walltime=48:00:00 We specify a desired name of our job: #PBS -N FreeSurfer_per_subject-time-longitudinal This specifies mail options: #PBS -m abe a means mail is sent when the job is aborted. b means mail is sent when the job begins. e means mail is sent when the job ends. Joins error output with regular output: #PBS -j oe All of these options can also be specified on the command-line and will overwrite any pragmas present in the script. Exercises # Create a file that contains this message: \"Hello, I am <user>\", where <user> is replaced by your username. Don't cheat by using an editor, use a command to create the file. Use another command to add this line to the same file: \"I am on system <hostname> in directory <current directory>\".

So, pulling out the fourth field in a whitespace delimited file is as follows: $ awk '{print $4}' mydata.dat You can use -F ':' to change the delimiter (F for field separator).

For example, if a command is taking too long, or you want to rerun it with different arguments. Variables # At the prompt we also have access to shell variables, which have both a name and a value .

Defining variables # There are several variables already defined for you when you start your session, such as $HOME which contains the path to your home directory. For a full overview of defined environment variables in your current session, you can use the env command. You can sort this output with sort to make it easier to search in: $ env | sort ... HOME=/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 ... You can also use the grep command to search for a piece of text. The following command will output all VSC-specific variable names and their values: $ env | sort | grep VSC But we can also define our own. this is done with the export command (note: variables are always all-caps as a convention): $ export MYVARIABLE=\"value\" It is important you don't include spaces around the = sign. Also note the lack of $ sign in front of the variable name. If we then do $ echo $MYVARIABLE this will output value . Note that the quotes are not included, they were only used when defining the variable to escape potential spaces in the value. Changing your prompt using $PS1 # You can change what your prompt looks like by redefining the special-purpose variable $PS1 . For example: to include the current location in your prompt: $ export PS1='\\w $' ~ $ cd test ~/test $ Note that ~ is short representation of your home directory. To make this persistent across session, you can define this custom value for $PS1 in your .profile startup script: $ echo 'export PS1=\"\\w $ \" ' >> ~/.profile Using non-defined variables # One common pitfall is the (accidental) use of non-defined variables. Contrary to what you may expect, this does not result in error messages, but the variable is considered to be empty instead. This may lead to surprising results, for example: $ export WORKDIR=/tmp/test $ pwd /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 $ echo $HOME /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 To understand what's going on here, see the section on cd below. The moral here is: be very careful to not use empty variables unintentionally . Tip for job scripts: use set -e -u to avoid using empty variables accidentally. The -e option will result in the script getting stopped if any command fails. The -u option will result in the script getting stopped if empty variables are used.

The moral here is: be very careful to not use empty variables unintentionally . Tip for job scripts: use set -e -u to avoid using empty variables accidentally.

To copy a directory, we use the -r option: $ cp -r sourceDirectory target A last more complicated example: $ cp -a sourceDirectory target Here we used the same cp command, but instead we gave it the -a option which tells cp to copy all the files and keep timestamps and permissions. Creating directories: \"mkdir\" # $ mkdir directory which will create a directory with the given name inside the current directory. Renaming/moving files: \"mv\" # $ mv source target mv will move the source path to the destination path. Works for both directories as files. Removing files: \"rm\" # Note: there are NO backups, there is no 'trash bin'. If you remove files/directories, they are gone. $ rm filename rm will remove a file or directory.

Removing a directory: \"rmdir\" # You can remove directories using rm -r directory , however, this is error prone and can ruin your day if you make a mistake in typing. To prevent this type of error, you can remove the contents of a directory using rm and then finally removing the directory with: $ rmdir directory Changing permissions: \"chmod\" # Every file, directory, and link has a set of permissions. These permissions consist of permission groups and permission types. The permission groups are: User - a particular user (account) Group - a particular group of users (may be user-specific group with only one member) Other - other users in the system The permission types are: Read - For files, this gives permission to read the contents of a file Write - For files, this gives permission to write data to the file. For directories it allows users to add or remove files to a directory. Execute - For files this gives permission to execute a file as through it were a script. For directories, it allows users to open the directory and look at the contents. Any time you run ls -l you'll see a familiar line of -rwx------ or similar combination of the letters r , w , x and - (dashes). These are the permissions for the file or directory.

The next entry is Project_GoldenDragon . We see it is a directory because the line begins with a d . It also has read, write, and execute permission for the vsc40000 user ( rwx ). So that user can look into the directory and add or remove files. Users in the mygroup can also look into the directory and read the files. But they can't add or remove files ( r-x ). Finally, other users can read files in the directory, but other users have no permissions to look in the directory at all ( --- ). Maybe we have a colleague who wants to be able to add files to the directory.

You can put multiple changes on the same line: chmod o-rwx,g-rxw,u+rx,u-w somefile will take everyone's permission away except the user's ability to read or execute the file. You can also use the -R flag to affect all the files within a directory, but this is dangerous. It's best to refine your search using find and then pass the resulting list to chmod since it's not usual for all files in a directory structure to have the same permissions. Access control lists (ACLs) # However, this means that all users in mygroup can add or remove files. This could be problematic if you only wanted one person to be allowed to help you administer the files in the project. We need a new group.

Zipping: \"gzip\"/\"gunzip\", \"zip\"/\"unzip\" # Files should usually be stored in a compressed file if they're not being used frequently. This means they will use less space and thus you get more out of your quota. Some types of files (e.g., CSV files with a lot of numbers) compress as much as 9:1. The most commonly used compression format on Linux is gzip.

If you unzip a file, the compressed file will be removed. To keep both, we send the data to stdout and redirect it to the target file: $ gzip -c myfile > myfile.gz $ gunzip -c myfile.gz > myfile \"zip\" and \"unzip\" # Windows and macOS seem to favour the zip file format, so it's also important to know how to unpack those. We do this using unzip: $ unzip myfile.zip If we would like to make our own zip archive, we use zip: $ zip myfiles.zip myfile1 myfile2 myfile3 Working with tarballs: \"tar\" # Tar stands for \"tape archive\" and is a way to bundle files together in a bigger file. You will normally want to unpack these files more often than you make them. To unpack a .tar file you use: $ tar -xf tarfile.tar Often, you will find gzip compressed .tar files on the web.

Finding files/directories: \"find\" # find will crawl a series of directories and lists files matching given criteria. For example, to look for the file named one.txt : $ cd $HOME $ find . -name one.txt ./some_directory/one.txt To look for files using incomplete names, you can use a wildcard * ; note that you need to escape the * to avoid that Bash expands it into afile.txt by adding double quotes: $ find . -name \"*.txt\" ./.hidden_file.txt ./afile.txt ./some_directory/one.txt ./some_directory/two.txt A more advanced use of the find command is to use the -exec flag to perform actions on the found file(s), rather than just printing their paths (see man find ).

For example, to copy a folder with lots of CSV files: $ rsync -rzv testfolder vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:data/ will copy the folder testfolder and its contents to $VSC_DATA on the , assuming the data symlink is present in your home directory, see section 4.2. .
