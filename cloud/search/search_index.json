Each cloud project can use one floating IP, a public IP address which you'll need to link to the resources you want to access. Optionally, if the project has requested access to VSC network it will receive also three VSC floating IPs (see section floating IP addresses ). By default, the UGent firewall blocks most IP addresses and ports. Only the port (TCP) range 50000-60000 for the public floating IP addresses is open by default. Contact cloud@vscentrum.be if you need to access other ports from the outside world. The OpenStack environment has its own internal firewalls, which block most ports of your instances by default. If you want to access specific ports of your instances, you must create \"Security Groups\" which allow access to those ports (see section security groups ). You can use one or more SSH keys from your VSC account to access your instances (see section SSH key pairs ). For other access methods, or SSH authentication for a wider set of users, you'll need to set up some form of identity management yourself. This system administration task is beyond the scope of our tutorial. The _vm, _vsc and _ nfs networks # Each project in the VSC cloud has its own network <projectname> _vm and --- if the project uses shares and/or vsc networks --- <projectname> _nfs and <projectname> _vsc respectively. Each is a subnet of 254 addresses, with an ip range 10.10.x.0/24, where x is a number that depends on the project and network. To see the subnets for your project's networks, open the Network tab, and select Networks. Instances should use the _vm network for communication, and the _ nfs network if they need access to shared file systems (see chapter shared file systems ). On the other hand _vsc network is used to connect to or provide VSC services via VSC network and floating or dedicated project's VSC IPs. When an instance is created in OpenStack and connected to the _vm, _ nfs or _vsc networks, it is automatically assigned a fixed local IP address in that network. This IP address is permanently associated with the instance until the instance is terminated. Floating IP addresses # The _vm, _ nfs and _vsc networks can only be reached from within the OpenStack environment. If you need to access an instance from the outside, you need to use one of your project's floating IP addresses, which are public IP addresses (193.190.80.0/25 IPs for _vm network) or VSC IP addresses (172.24.48.0/20 IPs for _vsc network). Unlike fixed IP addresses, floating IP addresses can have their associations modified at any time, regardless of the state of the instances involved. Do not release the floating IPs assigned to your project. The floating IPs are fixed to the project and it is not possible, as regular user, to re-allocate floating IPs. Please contact to VSC Tier1 Cloud support if you have released your project's floating IPs by mistake. This section explains how to make your instance accessible via a public IP address by two different methods. The preferred method for _vm network is to use port forwarding to access multiple instances using the same public IP address, but you can also use a \"floating IP association\" for quick tests or _vsc network. Floating ip port forwarding # OpenStack 's networking API, called Neutron, makes it possible to forward different ports of the same floating ip to arbitrary ports in one of OpenStack 's virtual networks. This is the recommended way to use floating ip's in the VSC cloud. For the floating IP's available in the VSC Cloud, the high port range 50000-60000 is open to the outside world, so it is most convenient to work with ports from this range. Contact if you need public access to another port for a specific ip address. You'll need to forward a separate port for every service you wish to reach. For example, if you want to access an instance using SSH , you'll need to create a port forwarding rule from a selected port of the floating IP, to the port in the _vm network where your instance's SSH server is listening (typically port 22). You can quickly set up such forwarding rules using neutron_port_forward , a command line tool available on the UGent login node , login.hpc.ugent.be . In order to use it, you must create an application credential for the role \"User\", and save it as an openrc file (see section application credentials on page ). Transfer the openrc file to your VSC storage space, so neutron_port_forward can read it. To set up new port forwarding rules, run the script providing the path to the openrc file as an argument to the -o option, and a file describing your port forwarding configuration as argument to the -m option: neutron_port_forward -o <openrc file> -m <ini-file> The following is an example configuration file: [DEFAULT] floatingip=193.190.85.40 network=_vm [classa] pattern=classa-(+\u0323) 22=52000:100:22 5900=55900 [classb] pattern=classb-(+\u0323) 80=52080 Here we define defaults for the floating ip and target network, and two classes. Instances are assigned to a class if their name matches the regular expression given in pattern . The value of pattern must be a valid Python regular expression, and the first capturing group (if any) must match an integer. Port forwarding rules are given in the form target=source(:multiplier:offset) . This will set up a forwarding rule from the floating IP port: (source + multiplier \u2217 i + offset) \u2192 target , where i is the integer matched by the first capturing group, and \"target\" is a port of the fixed IP for the instance in the chosen network, in this case the _vm network. \"multiplier\" and \"offset\" are optional and default to 1 and 0 respectively. In our example, this results in the following set of port forwarding rules for the public IP address 193.190.85.40: 52122 -> classa-1:22 52222 -> classa-2:22 ... 55901 -> classa-1:5900 55902 -> classa-2:5900 ... 52081 -> classb-1:80 52082 -> classb-2:80 ... This is another basic port forwarding configuration example without patterns, in this case just to connect via SSH using external port 52000 to a running VM called testvm: [DEFAULT] floatingip=193.190.85.40 network=_vm [testvm] 22=52000 You can also see an overview of existing port forwarding rules for the ip addresses in your configuration file using neutron_port_forward --show . Each rule has an internal id, which you can see if you combine the options --show and --id as follows: neutron_port_forward -o <openrc file> -m <ini-file> --show --id To remove port forwarding rules, use the option --remove=<list of id's> with a comma-separated list of the id's of the rules you want to remove. Please note that when you remove and reinstantiate a VM, OpenStack also removes the port forwarding rules assigned to this VM automatically. If you intantiate again the same VM you should run neutron_port_forward and restore the port forwarding rules. neutron_port_forward provides a few more options and advanced features, run the command with the --help option for more information. Associate a floating ip # A floating IP address can also be associated to an instance, just like the fixed IP addresses. Because this approach uses one of the few available floating ip addresses for every instance you want to connect to, you should only use it for testing purposes with _vm network or with _vsc network. If you want to use a floating ip for port forwarding as in the previous section, it cannot be associated to an instance at the same time. Use the following procedure to associate that address with a specific instance. Open the Network tab. Click the Floating IPs tab, which shows the floating IP addresses allocated to your project. In the Floating IPs list, click Associate next to the address you want. In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, choose the following options: IP Address This field is filled automatically. Port to be associated Select a port from the list. The list shows all the instances with their fixed IP addresses. Click Associate . Another way to associate a floating IP is after the user has already launched an instance which appears in the list of running instances in the Project->Compute->Instances tab: Expand the drop-down menu on right next to the instance Select Associate Floating IP A pop-up window will appear and under IP Address select from the drop-down menu an IP address from the available pool. Click Associate If the IP has been successfully associated in the upper right corner of the browser screen will appear a green confirmation. If not successful a red notification will pop up that something went wrong. To disassociate an IP address from an instance, click the Disassociate button in the Actions column. Do not use the Release Floating IP option in the Actions column or on the overview page. This will remove the floating IP from the pool assigned to your project, something which you, as a regular user, cannot undo. If you've accidentally released a floating IP, contact to have it restored. Security Groups # OpenStack security groups are sets of IP filter rules that define networking access. You can then assign one or more security groups to your instances. In the VSC cloud, each project contains a default security group, which allows you to ping instances and connect using SSH on the default port 22. If you want to access other ports on your instances, create new security groups with the appropriate rules and assign them to the instances. SSH key pairs # When an instance is launched, OpenStack can automatically install a public SSH key on it, so as to give anyone with the corresponding private key admin access. For this \"key pair injection 1 \" to work, the image that the instance is based on must contain the cloud-init package, or have in place another mechanism in place that will interact with the OpenStack metadata server to install the appropriate key. For general instructions on SSH keys, we refer to section Getting an HPC Account of our introduction to HPC . If you have generated a key pair with an external tool, you can import it into OpenStack . The key pair can be used for multiple instances that belong to a project. For more information, see section [import a key pair]](#import-a-key-pair). The public keys from your VSC account are automatically available in your VSC Cloud projects, so you can immediately inject one of your existing into your instances. Of course, you can also import new keys into OpenStack , which are not coupled to your VSC account. If you want to give other parties SSH access to VM's, you must manage the keys using some other method. upload SSH keys for other users to your VSC account. Every OpenStack user account has its own collection of SSH keys for every project. To share a public key between multiple users of the same project, each user needs to import it in the OpenStack project. Add a key pair # Open the Compute tab. Click the Key Pairs tab, which shows the key pairs that are available for this project. Click Create Key Pair. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a name for your key pair, and click Create Key Pair. Respond to the prompt to download the key pair. Save the *.pem file locally. To change its permissions so that only you can read and write to the file, run the following command: chmod 0600 yourPrivateKey.pem Note If you are using the OpenStack Dashboard from a Windows computer, use PuTTYgen to load the *.pem file and convert and save it as *.ppk . For more information see the WinSCP web page for PuTTYgen , and chapter 2 of the introduction to HPC at VSC . To make the key pair known to SSH , run the ssh-add command. ssh-add yourPrivateKey.pem Import a key pair # Open the Compute tab. Click the Key Pairs tab, which shows the key pairs that are available for this project. Click Import Key Pair. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter the name of your key pair, copy the public key into the Public Key box, and then click Import Key Pair. The Compute database registers the public key of the key pair. The OpenStack Dashboard lists the key pair on the Key Pairs tab. The OpenStack documentation and interfaces consistently refer to \" SSH pairs\", but of course only the public key of each pair is stored in the OpenStack environment, while the private key should be kept secure by the owner. \u21a9", "title": "Configure access and security for instance"}, {"location": "configure_instances/#configure-access-and-security-for-instance", "text": "The security and accessibility of your cloud resources is governed by a few different aspects, which we discuss more detail in the following sections: Instances must connect to the project's _vm network in order to get external internet access (see section _vm, _vsc and _nfs networks ).

In our example, this results in the following set of port forwarding rules for the public IP address 193.190.85.40: 52122 -> classa-1:22 52222 -> classa-2:22 ... 55901 -> classa-1:5900 55902 -> classa-2:5900 ... 52081 -> classb-1:80 52082 -> classb-2:80 ... This is another basic port forwarding configuration example without patterns, in this case just to connect via SSH using external port 52000 to a running VM called testvm: [DEFAULT] floatingip=193.190.85.40 network=_vm [testvm] 22=52000 You can also see an overview of existing port forwarding rules for the ip addresses in your configuration file using neutron_port_forward --show . Each rule has an internal id, which you can see if you combine the options --show and --id as follows: neutron_port_forward -o <openrc file> -m <ini-file> --show --id To remove port forwarding rules, use the option --remove=<list of id's> with a comma-separated list of the id's of the rules you want to remove. Please note that when you remove and reinstantiate a VM, OpenStack also removes the port forwarding rules assigned to this VM automatically. If you intantiate again the same VM you should run neutron_port_forward and restore the port forwarding rules. neutron_port_forward provides a few more options and advanced features, run the command with the --help option for more information.", "title": "Floating ip port forwarding"}, {"location": "configure_instances/#associate-a-floating-ip", "text": "A floating IP address can also be associated to an instance, just like the fixed IP addresses. Because this approach uses one of the few available floating ip addresses for every instance you want to connect to, you should only use it for testing purposes with _vm network or with _vsc network. If you want to use a floating ip for port forwarding as in the previous section, it cannot be associated to an instance at the same time. Use the following procedure to associate that address with a specific instance. Open the Network tab. Click the Floating IPs tab, which shows the floating IP addresses allocated to your project. In the Floating IPs list, click Associate next to the address you want. In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, choose the following options: IP Address This field is filled automatically. Port to be associated Select a port from the list. The list shows all the instances with their fixed IP addresses. Click Associate . Another way to associate a floating IP is after the user has already launched an instance which appears in the list of running instances in the Project->Compute->Instances tab: Expand the drop-down menu on right next to the instance Select Associate Floating IP A pop-up window will appear and under IP Address select from the drop-down menu an IP address from the available pool. Click Associate If the IP has been successfully associated in the upper right corner of the browser screen will appear a green confirmation. If not successful a red notification will pop up that something went wrong. To disassociate an IP address from an instance, click the Disassociate button in the Actions column.

VMs using UPS will keep up and running even if the datacenter suffers an unexpected power cut. ( CPUv1 ) and ( GPUv2 ) virtual machines are not supported by an UPS and will go offline when an unexpected power cut occurs. VSC Tier-1 Cloud instance types also provide different kind of network performance specifications. All the instance types are able to connect to the available networks: public network, VSC network and shared filesystem network (NFS). Note that VSC and shared file system network access is only made available if explicitly requested in the project application. VSC network gives an optimal path towards other VSC sites. This is ideal for high performance connections between different clusters and services within VSC. E.g. when you intend to do high data volume reshuffling between VMs and other Tier-1 components. Cloud projects should request VSC network if they want to connect to VSC Data component ( https://www.vscentrum.be/data ) with iRODS and Globus from their Tier1 Cloud VMs. On the other hand, the shared filesystem network is required by the OpenStack shared filesystem service (Manila) (see chapter 10 for more information). Flavor Sizes # A flavor size is a set of virtualized hardware resources to a virtual machine (VM) instance like system memory size (RAM), virtual cores (vCPUs) or the root filesystem size. The flavor's root disk size is the amount of disk space used by the root ( / ) partition, an ephemeral disk that the base image is copied into (see section launch an instance for more information about VM persistent/non-persistent instances). The flavor's root ephemeral storage is only used when booting from a non-persistent VM, but is not used when booting from a persistent storage volume or persistent VM. The flavor's root ephemeral size is not taken into account to calculate the project's local storage quota either. You can also create a persistent volume and choose the desired filesystem size for your persistent VM during the instantiation. VM persistent volumes could be resized later if that is necessary (see chapter launch an instance for more information). VSC Tier-1 Cloud VM flavors are grouped by instance types (see table ). Several flavor sizes are available for each instance type, differing in the number of allocated vCPUs, RAM and storage size. Every GPU flavor in addition allocates one full GPU card.

You can launch an instance from the following sources: Images uploaded to the Image service. Note Because images are read-only, any changes made while the instance is running will be lost when the instance is deleted, unless you choose to create a persistent volume for your instance when you launch it. Using a volume, the VM's state is saved, even when the current instance is deleted. Images which you previously copied to a persistent volume. The instance launches from the volume. Instance snapshots. Launch an instance # Open the Compute tab and select the Instances category. The dashboard shows the list of existing instances with their name, IP addresses, flavor, status, power state, ... Click Launch Instance . In the Launch Instance dialog box, specify the following values: Details tab # Instance Name # Assign a name to the virtual machine. Tip The name you assign here becomes the initial host name of the server. If the name is longer than 63 characters, the Compute service truncates it automatically to ensure dnsmasq works correctly. After the server is built, if you change the server name in the API or change the host name directly, the names are not updated in the dashboard. Server names are not guaranteed to be unique when created so you could have two instances with the same host name. Description # You can assign a brief description of the virtual machine. Availability Zone # Large-scale OpenStack systems may consist of multiple availability zones, which are groups of hypervisors connected to different power sources. By assigning instances to different availability zones, users can protect themselves against power failures. However, the VSC cloud consists of just a single zone, called . Count # To launch multiple instances, enter a value greater than . The default is 1 . Source tab # Select Boot Source # Your options are: Image Image snapshot Volume Volume snapshot Depending on the type of boot source, the list of available items changes. Create New Volume # If you enable this option when launching from an image or instance snapshot, the image or snapshot will be copied to a volume. This way, the state of your instance persists after shutdown and reboot. Flavor tab # Specify the size of the instance to launch. Note The flavor is selected based on the size of the image selected for launching an instance. For example, while creating an image, if you have entered the value in the Minimum RAM (MB) field as 2048, then on selecting the image, the default flavor is CPUv1.small (see section instance type for more information). If a :exclamation: warning sign is displayed next to a resource for one of the flavors, that means that this flavor would exceed the project's quota for that resource, and therefore is not available. Networks tab # Add one or more networks to the instance. Network Ports tab # Activate the ports that you want to assign to the instance. Security Groups tab # Activate the security groups that you want to assign to the instance. Security groups are a kind of cloud firewall that define which incoming network traffic is forwarded to instances. See section configure access for more information. The default security group is assigned to the instance automatically. Key Pair tab # Specify a key pair. If the image uses a static root password or a static key set (neither is recommended), you do not need to provide a key pair to launch the instance. Configuration tab # Specify a customization script that runs after your instance launches. Server Groups tab # You can organize instances into groups with a scheduling policy. With an \"affinity\" policy, OpenStack will try to schedule those instances on the same hypervisors, which is useful for instances that need to communicate with each other a lot. With an \"anti-affinity\" policy, instances will be scheduled on different hypervisors, which you might use for instances that provide redundant copies of a single service. Scheduler Hints tab # By providing scheduler hints, you can get more fine grained control over which hypervisor your instances are scheduled on. Metadata tab # Add Metadata items to your instance. Click Launch Instance The instance starts on a compute node in the cloud. Note If you did not provide a key pair, security groups, or rules, users can access the instance only from inside the cloud through VNC. Even pinging the instance is not possible without an ICMP rule configured. You can also launch an instance from the Images or Volumes category when you launch an instance from an image or a volume respectively. When you launch an instance from an image, OpenStack creates a local copy of the image on the compute node where the instance starts. For details on creating images, see Creating images manually in the OpenStack Virtual Machine Image Guide . Connect to an instance using SSH # Before you can connect to an instance using SSH , you must set up a floating IP for it, as discussed in section floating-ip . Recall that only ports 50000 to 60000 of the floating IP's can be directly reached from outside the UGent network. Note When you try to connect to a new instance using a port that was previously forwarded to a different instance --- either due to a change in the port forwarding configuration, or because an old instance was deleted and replaced --- your SSH client will show an error message because the \"host key\" of the new instance doesn't match the known previous key. Section explains how to handle such errors. Note If you want to access ports outside the public range, you'll need to connect to the UGent login node login.hpc.ugent.be first, and hop to your instance from there. To make this work without storing the required private key for the instance in your VSC storage space, you need to set up an SSH agent with key forwarding locally, i.e. on the machine where you store the private key of an authorized keypair for the instance. Section 2.1.4 of the HPC introduction explains how to set this up ( hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs ). ( Only if using a port blocked by the UGent firewall, see the note above: ) Use your VSC account to connect to the UGent login node , using the ssh -A option to enable agent forwarding: ssh -A vsc12345@login.hpc.ugent.be Copy the address of the floating IP where your instance can be reached. In our example, the address is 193.190.85.40. Connect to the instance. Use OpenSSH's -p option to specify the port where the instance's SSH server can be reached, e.g. for port 50022: ssh -A -p 50022 ubuntu@193.190.85.40 When you run the above command, your SSH client may display warnings or error messages. The section Host Keys Host Keys explains the meaning of these messages and how you should deal with them. Info The images we provide do not allow SSH logins for the root user. There is a default user instead, who can get administrative privileges using sudo . In our example, we have used the username ubuntu for Ubuntu images. Attempting to log in as root will return an error message with the proper user name. Host keys # When connecting to instances using SSH , you will sometimes see warnings or errors related to \"host keys\". This section briefly explains the meaning of those errors, and how to deal with them. When you try to connect to an instance, you use the private key of your SSH keypair to prove your identity to that instance. If you do not have access to the right secret key, you can not prove your identity, at which point the your instance's SSH server will deny access. In the same way, the server must prove its own identity to you, using its own keypair or \"host key\". Without such a verification procedure, third parties on the network between you and the instance could perform a so-called man-in-the-middle-attack, where they intercept the communication between you and the server you want to reach and steal valuable information. To prevent such man-in-the-middle attacks, the SSH client on your system stores the host key for every IP address you have connected to, and verifies the key the next time you try to connect to that address. If all goes well, this check is silently performed in the background, but there are a number of situations where the check fails. In this case, you have to look up the host key of your instance in the OpenStack dashboard to verify that the connection is secure. Looking up an instance's host key # In order to verify a host key, it suffices to compare the key's fingerprint, a short alphanumerical sequence computed from the keys content. You can use the Dashboard to look up the host key fingerprint for an instance as follows: Open the Compute tab and select the Instances category. Click on the name of the instance you want to connect to. Click Log Click . You are taken to a new page with a long text listing. Search for the words -----BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS----- to find the log file section containing the host key fingerprints, for example: <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: ############################################################# <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: -----BEGIN SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS----- <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: 1024 SHA256:gCa0hZAaOnpzxYM5WnAZINuZTI5NAoqd41U/dtxeGKE root@my-instance (DSA) <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: 256 SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg root@my-instance (ECDSA) <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: 256 SHA256:Mcznquek1A3BFz6KEXSxsivpdkX1mY3LnymEA7C8Xxg root@my-instance (ED25519) <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: 2048 SHA256:4DagYc9cZvANkSjbTL0pB+3ULqHg09zW4E8wvDrB4Do root@my-instance (RSA) <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: -----END SSH HOST KEY FINGERPRINTS----- <14>Jun 6 09:57:01 ec2: ############################################################# In this example, the fingerprints are character sequences starting with \"SHA256\", such as the ECDSA key fingerprint SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg . The following sections describe the most common cases where you'll need these fingerprints. The following examples show output and commands for OpenSSH, the most common client on Linux and macOS. If you are working from a windows system using using PuTTY, we refer to PuTTY section of the windows version of the introduction to HPC for the corresponding warning messages. Connecting for the first time # The first time you connect to a new ip address:port combination, your SSH client does not know the host key for this address, and therefore it can't verify the identity of the server. When using OpenSSH, the warning looks as follows (again using address 193.190.85.40 and port 50022 as an example): The authenticity of host '[193.190.85.40]:50022 ([193.190.85.40]:50022)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? Verify the fingerprint in order to make sure that it is safe to proceed: Look up the fingerprint of the instance you want to access, according to the procedure described in the section . Verify that the fingerprint you find in the Dashboard matches the fingerprint shown in the warning message. In this example, we see that the ECDSA key fingerprint reported by the SSH client matches the fingerprint of our instance from the previous section, namely SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg If the fingerprints are identical, type \"yes\" to log in. Warning If the fingerprints do not match, type no , and contact cloud@vscentrum.be . New instance at a known address # Another case where the host key verification fails, is when you try to access a new instance at an IP address and port previously used by another instance. This can happen if you modify your port forwarding configuration, or if a running instance connected to a certain port is deleted and replaced by a new one. In this case, OpenSSH will show a warning such as this: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY! Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)! It is also possible that a host key has just been changed. The fingerprint for the ECDSA key sent by the remote host is SHA256:hI2HcqFxsCKwEauq2QvBmgDN4nCPjllaRsYoCb7tJQw. Please contact your system administrator. Add correct host key in [...]/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message. Offending ECDSA key in [...]/.ssh/known_hosts:57 ECDSA host key for [193.190.85.40]:50322 has changed and you have requested strict checking. Host key verification failed. The file known_hosts in your OpenSSH configuration directory contains a list of all hosts you have previously connected to, together with their host keys. The warning above tells you that the server you are connecting to is not using the same key anymore. In this case, you should take the following steps: Look up the fingerprint of the instance you want to access, according to the procedure described in the section Looking up an instance\u2019s host key. Verify that the fingerprint you find in the Dashboard matches the fingerprint shown in the warning message. If the fingerprint matches, the new key is legitimate. Remove the previous known key from the known_hosts file as follows (still using address 193.190.85.40 and port number 50322 as an example): ssh-keygen -R [ 193 .190.85.40 ] :50322 This command causes OpenSSH to forget the previous key. On your next attempt to connect to that address, OpenSSH will treat it as a new host and ask you to verify the fingerprint as described in section Connecting for the first time. Warning If the fingerprint does not match, do not attempt to connect, and contact cloud@vscentrum.be . Track usage for instances # You can track usage for instances for each project.

Difference between suspend , pause , shelve , shut off , delete # Pause Stores the state of the VM in the (RAM) memory . Suspend Stores the state of the VM on the disk, all memory is written to disk, and the server is stopped.

Recall that only ports 50000 to 60000 of the floating IP's can be directly reached from outside the UGent network. Note When you try to connect to a new instance using a port that was previously forwarded to a different instance --- either due to a change in the port forwarding configuration, or because an old instance was deleted and replaced --- your SSH client will show an error message because the \"host key\" of the new instance doesn't match the known previous key. Section explains how to handle such errors. Note If you want to access ports outside the public range, you'll need to connect to the UGent login node login.hpc.ugent.be first, and hop to your instance from there. To make this work without storing the required private key for the instance in your VSC storage space, you need to set up an SSH agent with key forwarding locally, i.e. on the machine where you store the private key of an authorized keypair for the instance. Section 2.1.4 of the HPC introduction explains how to set this up ( hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs ). ( Only if using a port blocked by the UGent firewall, see the note above: ) Use your VSC account to connect to the UGent login node , using the ssh -A option to enable agent forwarding: ssh -A vsc12345@login.hpc.ugent.be Copy the address of the floating IP where your instance can be reached. In our example, the address is 193.190.85.40. Connect to the instance. Use OpenSSH's -p option to specify the port where the instance's SSH server can be reached, e.g. for port 50022: ssh -A -p 50022 ubuntu@193.190.85.40 When you run the above command, your SSH client may display warnings or error messages. The section Host Keys Host Keys explains the meaning of these messages and how you should deal with them. Info The images we provide do not allow SSH logins for the root user.

This section briefly explains the meaning of those errors, and how to deal with them. When you try to connect to an instance, you use the private key of your SSH keypair to prove your identity to that instance. If you do not have access to the right secret key, you can not prove your identity, at which point the your instance's SSH server will deny access. In the same way, the server must prove its own identity to you, using its own keypair or \"host key\". Without such a verification procedure, third parties on the network between you and the instance could perform a so-called man-in-the-middle-attack, where they intercept the communication between you and the server you want to reach and steal valuable information. To prevent such man-in-the-middle attacks, the SSH client on your system stores the host key for every IP address you have connected to, and verifies the key the next time you try to connect to that address. If all goes well, this check is silently performed in the background, but there are a number of situations where the check fails.

Note Please note that the script shows you the ssh command to connect to each VM after instantiation (including the port which is generated automatically by the script). You can copy this list or you can review it later. Also note that you should use a valid user to connect to the VM, for instance for CentOS images is centos , for Ubuntu images is ubuntu and so on. You can also try to connect as root user, in that case the system will show you a message with the user that you should use. Modify default Terraform modules # In section we have downloaded the Terraform module examples from the VSC repository. If you deploy these modules as it is it will deploy several VM examples by default such as: myvm: simple VM with 20Gb persistent volume and ssh access with port forwarding. myvm-nginx: Like previous example but with an ansible playbook to install nginx and access to port 80 besides ssh. myvm-vsc_net: Similar to the first example but also includes a VSC network interface (only available for some projects). myvm-nfs_share: Similar to the first example but it creates a NFS share filesystem and it mounts it during instantiation (only available for some projects). But usually you do not want to deploy all these examples, you can just keep the required module and comment out the rest. You can do this from environment directory: cd ~/openstack-templates/terraform/environment And edit main.tf Terraform file with any text editor like vim or nano.

Users can deploy a data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or using JSON. Terraform has some advantages over OpenStack Heat service. It is has a simple syntax, it can provision virtual infrastructures across multiple cloud providers (not only OpenStack ) and it provides important features not supported by Heat at this moment, like network port forwarding rules (see floating-ip ). This means that with Terraform , scripts like neutron_port_forward (see port forwarding script ) are no longer needed. Terraform is currently one of the most popular infrastructure automation tools available. VSC Cloud also provides some template examples that could be used to deploy virtual infrastructures within VSC Tier-1 Cloud in an automated way ( https://github.com/hpcugent/openstack-templates/tree/master/terraform ).
