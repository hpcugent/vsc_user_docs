<p>Instances are virtual machines that run inside the cloud. You can launch
an <em>instance</em> from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images uploaded to the Image service.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Because images are read-only, any changes made while the instance is
running will be lost when the instance is deleted, unless you choose
to create a persistent volume for your instance when you launch it.
Using a volume, the VM's state is saved, even when the current
instance is deleted.</p>
</div>

<p>The flavor is selected based on the size of the image selected

2048, then on selecting the image, the default flavor is <strong>CPUv1.small</strong>
(see section <a href="../flavors/#instance-types-and-flavors">instance type</a> for
more information). If a :exclamation: warning sign is displayed next to a resource

Popular implementations include OpenSSH on Linux/Mac and Putty on Windows.">SSH</abbr> client does not know the host key for this address, and therefore it
can't verify the identity of the server. When using OpenSSH, the warning
looks as follows (again using address 193.190.85.40 and port 50022 as an
example):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The authenticity of host &#39;[193.190.85.40]:50022
([193.190.85.40]:50022)&#39; can&#39;t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint
is SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg. Are you sure you
want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</code></pre></div>
<p>Verify the fingerprint in order to make sure that it is safe to proceed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Look up the fingerprint of the instance you want to access,
    according to the procedure described in the section .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify that the fingerprint you find in the Dashboard matches the
    fingerprint shown in the warning message.</p>
<p>In this example, we see that the ECDSA key fingerprint reported by
the <abbr title="Secure Shell (SSH), sometimes known as Secure Socket Shell, is a Unix-based command interface and protocol for securely getting access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to control Web and other kinds of servers remotely. SSH is actually a suite of three utilities (slogin, ssh, and scp) that are secure versions of the earlier UNIX utilities, rlogin, rsh, and rcp. SSH commands are encrypted and secure in several ways. Both ends of the client/server connection are authenticated using a digital certificate, and passwords are protected by encryption. Popular implementations include OpenSSH on Linux/Mac and Putty on Windows.">SSH</abbr> client matches the fingerprint of our instance from the
previous section, namely</p>
<p><em>SHA256:nyujUIF37c674FPSkDdz0xgAU6S39UWbmMzBPmdmCmg</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the fingerprints are identical, type "yes" to log in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If the fingerprints do not match, type <strong>no</strong>, and contact <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#100;&#64;&#118;&#115;&#99;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#46;&#98;&#101;">&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#100;&#64;&#118;&#115;&#99;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#46;&#98;&#101;</a>.</p>

<h4 id="new-instance-at-a-known-address">New instance at a known address<a class="headerlink" href="#new-instance-at-a-known-address" title="Permanent link">#</a></h4>
<p>Another case where the host key verification fails, is when you try to
access a new instance at an IP address and port previously used by
another instance. This can happen if you modify your port forwarding
configuration, or if a running instance connected to a certain port is
deleted and replaced by a new one. In this case, OpenSSH will show a
warning such as this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY! Someone could be
eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)! It is also
possible that a host key has just been changed. The fingerprint for the
ECDSA key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:hI2HcqFxsCKwEauq2QvBmgDN4nCPjllaRsYoCb7tJQw. Please contact your
system administrator. Add correct host key in [...]/.ssh/known_hosts
to get rid of this message. Offending ECDSA key in
[...]/.ssh/known_hosts:57 ECDSA host key for [193.190.85.40]:50322
has changed and you have requested strict checking. Host key
verification failed.
</code></pre></div>
<p>The file <em>known_hosts</em> in your OpenSSH configuration directory contains
a list of all hosts you have previously connected to, together with
their host keys. The warning above tells you that the server you are
connecting to is not using the same key anymore. In this case, you
should take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the fingerprint of the instance you want to access, according to the procedure described in the section Looking up an instance’s host key.</li>
<li>Verify that the fingerprint you find in the Dashboard matches the fingerprint shown in the warning message.</li>
<li>If the fingerprint matches, the new key is legitimate. Remove the previous known key from the known_hosts file as follows (still using address 193.190.85.40 and port number 50322 as an example):</li>
</ol>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh-keygen -R <span class="o">[</span><span class="m">193</span>.190.85.40<span class="o">]</span>:50322
</code></pre></div>
This command causes OpenSSH to forget the previous key. On your next attempt to
connect to that address, OpenSSH will treat it as a new host and ask you to verify the
fingerprint as described in section Connecting for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Shut off</strong></p>
<p>The server is powered down by the user, either through the <abbr title="OpenStack (https://www.openstack.org) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available to customers">OpenStack</abbr>

associated with the VM. The instance can be later restarted.</p>
<p><strong>Shelve</strong></p>
<p>Shelving stops the instance and takes a snapshot of it. Then
depending on the value of the <em>shelved_offload_time</em> config option,
the instance is either deleted from the hypervisor (0), never
deleted (-1), or deleted after some period of time (&gt; 0). Shelve
preserves all associated data and VM resources but does not retain
anything in <abbr title="A quantity of physical memory (RAM). Memory is provided by compute nodes. It is required as a constraint or consumed as a consumable resource by jobs. Within Moab, memory is tracked and reported in megabytes (MB).">memory</abbr>.</p>

However, for instances backed by a persistent volume, this volume is not deleted.
When such an instance is deleted, you can restore it by launching a
new instance from the volume, or delete the volume as well (see
