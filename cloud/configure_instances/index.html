<h1 id="configure-access-and-security-for-instance">Configure access and security for instance<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-access-and-security-for-instance" title="Permanent link">#</a></h1>
<p>The security and accessibility of your cloud resources is governed by a
few different aspects, which we discuss more detail in the following
sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instances must connect to the project's _vm network in order to get
    external internet access (see section
    <a href="#the-_vm-_vsc-and-_nfs-networks">_vm, _vsc and _nfs networks</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each cloud project can use one floating IP, a public IP address
    which you'll need to link to the resources you want to access.
    Optionally, if the project has requested access to VSC network it
    will receive also three VSC floating IPs (see section
    <a href="#floating-ip-addresses">floating IP addresses</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, the UGent firewall blocks most IP addresses and ports.
    Only the port (TCP) range <strong>50000-60000</strong> for the public floating IP addresses
    is open by default. Contact <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#100;&#64;&#118;&#115;&#99;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#46;&#98;&#101;">&#99;&#108;&#111;&#117;&#100;&#64;&#118;&#115;&#99;&#101;&#110;&#116;&#114;&#117;&#109;&#46;&#98;&#101;</a> if you need to access other ports from
    the outside world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <abbr title="OpenStack (https://www.openstack.org) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available to customers">OpenStack</abbr> environment has its own internal firewalls, which
    block most ports of your instances by default. If you want to access
    specific ports of your instances, you must create "Security Groups"
    which allow access to those ports (see section
    <a href="#security-groups">security groups</a>).</p>

If you need to access an instance from the
outside, you need to use one of your project's floating IP addresses,
which are public IP addresses (193.190.80.0/25 IPs for _vm network) or
VSC IP addresses (172.24.48.0/20 IPs for _vsc network). Unlike fixed IP
addresses, floating IP addresses can have their associations modified at
any time, regardless of the state of the instances involved.</p>
<p>Do not release the floating IPs assigned to your project. The floating
IPs are fixed to the project and it is not possible, as regular user, to
re-allocate floating IPs. Please contact to VSC Tier1 Cloud support if
you have released your project's floating IPs by mistake.</p>
<p>This section explains how to make your instance accessible via a public
IP address by two different methods. The preferred method for _vm
network is to use port forwarding to access multiple instances using the
same public IP address, but you can also use a "floating IP association"
for quick tests or _vsc network.</p>

This is the recommended way to use
floating ip's in the VSC cloud. For the floating IP's available in the
VSC Cloud, the high port range 50000-60000 is open to the outside world,
so it is most convenient to work with ports from this range. Contact if
you need public access to another port for a specific ip address.</p>
<p>You'll need to forward a separate port for every service you wish to
reach. For example, if you want to access an instance using <abbr title="Secure Shell (SSH), sometimes known as Secure Socket Shell, is a Unix-based command interface and protocol for securely getting access to a remote computer.

<p>You can quickly set up such forwarding rules using
<code>neutron_port_forward</code>, a command line tool available on the UGent login
<abbr title="A node attribute is a non-quantitative aspect of a node. Attributes typically describe the node itself or possibly aspects of various node resources such as processors or memory. While it is probably not optimal to aggregate node and resource attributes together in this manner, it is common practice. Common node attributes include processor architecture, operating system, and processor speed. Jobs often specify that resources be allocated from nodes possessing certain node attributes.">node</abbr>, <strong>login.hpc.ugent.be</strong>. In order to use it, you must create an
application credential for the role "User", and save it as an openrc
file (see section <a href="../access/#application-credentials">application credentials</a>
on page ). Transfer the openrc file to your
VSC storage space, so <em>neutron_port_forward</em> can read it. To set up new
port forwarding rules, run the script providing the path to the openrc
file as an argument to the <em>-o</em> option, and a file describing your port
forwarding configuration as argument to the <em>-m</em> option:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>neutron_port_forward -o &lt;openrc file&gt; -m &lt;ini-file&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The following is an example configuration file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[DEFAULT]
floatingip=193.190.85.40
network=_vm

[classa]
pattern=classa-(+̣)
22=52000:100:22
5900=55900

[classb]
pattern=classb-(+̣)
80=52080
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we define defaults for the floating ip and target network, and two
classes. Instances are assigned to a class if their name matches the
regular expression given in <code>pattern</code>. The value of <code>pattern</code> must be a
valid Python regular expression, and the first capturing group (if any)
must match an integer.</p>
<p>Port forwarding rules are given in the form
<code>target=source(:multiplier:offset)</code>. This will set up a forwarding rule
from the floating IP port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(source + multiplier ∗ i + offset) → target ,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <strong><em>i</em></strong> is the integer matched by the first capturing group, and
"target" is a port of the fixed IP for the instance in the chosen
network, in this case the _vm network. "multiplier" and "offset" are
optional and default to 1 and 0 respectively. In our example, this
results in the following set of port forwarding rules for the public IP
address 193.190.85.40:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>  52122   -&gt;   classa-1:22
  52222   -&gt;   classa-2:22
  ...     
  55901   -&gt;   classa-1:5900
  55902   -&gt;   classa-2:5900

  52081   -&gt;   classb-1:80
  52082   -&gt;   classb-2:80
  ...     
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is another basic port forwarding configuration example without
patterns, in this case just to connect via <abbr title="Secure Shell (SSH), sometimes known as Secure Socket Shell, is a Unix-based command interface and protocol for securely getting access to a remote computer.

22=52000
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also see an overview of existing port forwarding rules for the
ip addresses in your configuration file using
<em>neutron_port_forward --show</em>. Each rule has an internal id, which you
can see if you combine the options <em>--show</em> and <em>--id</em> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>neutron_port_forward -o &lt;openrc file&gt; -m &lt;ini-file&gt; --show --id
</code></pre></div>
<p>To remove port forwarding rules, use the option
<code>--remove=&lt;list of id's&gt;</code> with a comma-separated list of the id's of the
rules you want to remove.</p>
<p>Please note that when you remove and reinstantiate a VM, <abbr title="OpenStack (https://www.openstack.org) is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available to customers">OpenStack</abbr> also
removes the port forwarding rules assigned to this VM automatically. If
you intantiate again the same VM you should run <code>neutron_port_forward</code>
and restore the port forwarding rules.</p>

features, run the command with the <code>--help</code> option for more information.</p>
<h3 id="associate-a-floating-ip">Associate a floating ip<a class="headerlink" href="#associate-a-floating-ip" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>A floating IP address can also be associated to an instance, just like
the fixed IP addresses. Because this approach uses one of the few
available floating ip addresses for every instance you want to connect
to, you should only use it for testing purposes with _vm network or
with _vsc network.</p>
<p>If you want to use a floating ip for port forwarding as in the previous
section, it cannot be associated to an instance at the same time.</p>
<p>Use the following procedure to associate that address with a specific
instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the Network tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Floating IPs tab, which shows the floating IP addresses
    allocated to your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Floating IPs list, click Associate next to the address you
    want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, choose the
    following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Address</strong>
This field is filled automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Port to be associated</strong>
Select a port from the list. The list shows all the instances
with their fixed IP addresses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Associate</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to associate a floating IP is after the user has already
launched an instance which appears in the list of running instances in
the Project-&gt;Compute-&gt;Instances tab:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Expand the drop-down menu on right next to the instance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Associate Floating IP</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../img/associate_IP_1.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pop-up window will appear and under IP Address select from the
    drop-down menu an IP address from the available pool.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../img/associate_IP_2.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Associate</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the IP has been successfully associated in the upper right corner of
the browser screen will appear a green confirmation. If not successful a
red notification will pop up that something went wrong.</p>
<p>To disassociate an IP address from an instance, click the Disassociate
button in the Actions column.</p>
<p><em>Do not</em> use the Release Floating IP option in the Actions column or on
the overview page. This will remove the floating IP from the pool
assigned to your project, something which you, as a regular user, cannot
undo. If you've accidentally released a floating IP, contact to have it
restored.</p>
