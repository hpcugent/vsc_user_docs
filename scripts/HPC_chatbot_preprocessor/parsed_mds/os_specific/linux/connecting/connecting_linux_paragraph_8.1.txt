Changing login nodes
Using a GUI
If you prefer a GUI to transfer files back and forth to the HPC, you can
use your file browser. Open your file browser and press
++"Ctrl"+"l"++
This should open up a address bar where you can enter a URL.
Alternatively, look for the "connect to server" option in your file
browsers menu.
Enter: sftp://vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be/ and press enter.
You should now be able to browse files on the HPC in your file browser.
Fast file transfer for large datasets
See the section on rsync in chapter 5 of the Linux intro manual.
Changing login nodes
It can be useful to have control over which login node you are on. However, when you connect to the HPC (High-Performance Computing) system, you are directed to a random login node, which might not be the one where you already have an active session. To address this, there is a way to manually switch your active login node.
For instance, if you want to switch to the login node named gligar07.gastly.os, you can use the following command while you are connected to the gligar08.gastly.os login node on the HPC:
ssh gligar07.gastly.os
This is also possible the other way around.
