If you're still using the terminal that is connected to the HPC, close the
connection by typing "exit" in the terminal window.
For example, we will copy the (local) file "localfile.txt" to your
home directory on the HPC cluster. We first generate a small dummy
"localfile.txt", which contains the word "Hello". Use your own VSC
account, which is something like "vsc40000". Don't forget the colon (:) at the
end: if you forget it, it will just create a file named vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be on your
local filesystem. You can even specify where to save the file on the
remote filesystem by putting a path after the colon.
$ echo "Hello" > localfile.txt
$ ls -l 
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 user  staff   6 Sep 18 09:37 localfile.txt
$ scp localfile.txt vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:
localfile.txt     100%   6     0.0KB/s     00:00
