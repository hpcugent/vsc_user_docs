Using sftp
The SSH File Transfer Protocol (also Secure File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file
transfer and file management functionalities over any reliable data
stream. It was designed as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol
(SSH) version 2.0. This protocol assumes that it is run over a secure
channel, such as SSH, that the server has already authenticated the
client, and that the identity of the client user is available to the
protocol.
The sftp is an equivalent of the ftp command, with the difference that
it uses the secure ssh protocol to connect to the clusters.
