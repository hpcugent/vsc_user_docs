Transfer Files to/from the HPC
Before you can do some work, you'll have to transfer the files you need from your desktop or department to the cluster. At the end of a job, you might want to transfer some files back.
The preferred way to transfer files is by using an scp or sftp via the
secure OpenSSH protocol.  ships with an implementation of OpenSSH, so you
don't need to install any third-party software to use it. Just open a
terminal window and jump in!
