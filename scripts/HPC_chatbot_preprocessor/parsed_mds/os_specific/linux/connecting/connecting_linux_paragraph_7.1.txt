Transfer Files tofrom the HPC
Using scp
Secure copy or SCP is a tool (command) for securely transferring files between a local
host (= your computer) and a remote host (the HPC). It is based on the
Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The scp command is the equivalent of the cp (i.e.,
copy) command, but can copy files to or from remote machines.
It's easier to copy files directly to $VSC_DATA and $VSC_SCRATCH if
you have symlinks to them in your home directory. See 
the chapter titled "Uploading/downloading/editing files", section "Symlinks for data/scratch" in the intro to Linux
 for how to do this.
Open an additional terminal window and check that you're working on your
local machine.
$ hostname
<local-machine-name>
If you're still using the terminal that is connected to the HPC, close the
connection by typing "exit" in the terminal window.
For example, we will copy the (local) file "localfile.txt" to your
home directory on the HPC cluster. We first generate a small dummy
"localfile.txt", which contains the word "Hello". Use your own VSC
account, which is something like "vsc40000". Don't forget the colon (:) at the
end: if you forget it, it will just create a file named vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be on your
local filesystem. You can even specify where to save the file on the
remote filesystem by putting a path after the colon.
$ echo "Hello" > localfile.txt
$ ls -l 
...
-rw-r--r-- 1 user  staff   6 Sep 18 09:37 localfile.txt
$ scp localfile.txt vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:
localfile.txt     100%   6     0.0KB/s     00:00
Connect to the HPC via another terminal, print the working directory (to
make sure you're in the home directory) and check whether the file has
arrived:
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
$ ls -l 
total 1536
drwxrwxr-x 2
drwxrwxr-x 2
drwxrwxr-x 10
-rw-r--r-- 1
$ cat localfile.txt
Hello
