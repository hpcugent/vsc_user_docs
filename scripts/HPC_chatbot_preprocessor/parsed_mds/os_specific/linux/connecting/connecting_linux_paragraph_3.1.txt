First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure
Connect
Open up a terminal and enter the following command to connect to the HPC.
ssh vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be
Here, user vsc40000 wants to make a connection to the "hpcugent" cluster at UGent via the login
node "login.hpc.ugent.be", so replace vsc40000 with your own VSC id in the above command.
The first time you make a connection to the login node, you will be
asked to verify the authenticity of the login node. Please check
Warning message when first connecting to new host on how to do this.
A possible error message you can get if you previously saved your
private key somewhere else than the default location
($HOME/.ssh/id_rsa):
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
In this case, use the -i option for the ssh command to specify the
location of your private key. For example:
ssh -i /home/example/my_keys
Congratulations, you're on the HPC infrastructure now!
To find out where you have landed you can print the current working directory:
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
Your new private home directory is "/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000". Here you can create your own
subdirectory structure, copy and prepare your applications, compile and
test them and submit your jobs on the HPC.
$ cd /apps/gent/tutorials
$ ls
Intro-HPC/
This directory currently contains all training material for the Introduction to the HPC. More
relevant training material to work with the HPC can always be added later in
this directory.
You can now explore the content of this directory with the "ls --l" (lists long) and the "cd" (change directory) commands:
As we are interested in the use of the HPC, move further to Intro-HPC and explore the
contents up to 2 levels deep:
$ cd Intro-HPC
$ tree -L 2
