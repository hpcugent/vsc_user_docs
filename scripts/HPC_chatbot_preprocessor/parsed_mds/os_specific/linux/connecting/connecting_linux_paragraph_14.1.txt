Using a GUI
If you prefer a GUI to transfer files back and forth to the HPC, you can
use your file browser. Open your file browser and press
++"Ctrl"+"l"++
This should open up a address bar where you can enter a URL.
Alternatively, look for the "connect to server" option in your file
browsers menu.
Enter: sftp://vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be/ and press enter.
You should now be able to browse files on the HPC in your file browser.
