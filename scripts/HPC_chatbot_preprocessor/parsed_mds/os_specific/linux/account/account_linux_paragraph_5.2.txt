OpenSSH is a FREE implementation of the SSH connectivity protocol.  comes
with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you don't need to install any
third-party software to use it. Just open a terminal window and jump in!
On all popular Linux distributions, the OpenSSH software is readily
available, and most often installed by default. You can check whether
the OpenSSH software is installed by opening a terminal and typing:
$ ssh -V
OpenSSH_7.4p1, OpenSSL 1.0.2k-fips 26 Jan 2017
To access the clusters and transfer your files, you will use the
following commands:
1.  ssh-keygen: to generate the SSH key pair (public + private key);
2.  ssh: to open a shell on a remote machine;
3.  sftp: a secure equivalent of ftp;
4.  scp: a secure equivalent of the remote copy command rcp.
