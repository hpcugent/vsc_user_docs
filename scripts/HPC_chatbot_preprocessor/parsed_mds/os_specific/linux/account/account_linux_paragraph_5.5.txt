This will ask you for a file name to store the private and public key,
and a passphrase to protect your private key. It needs to be emphasised
that you really should choose the passphrase wisely! The system will ask
you for it every time you want to use the private key that is every time
you want to access the cluster or transfer your files.
Without your key pair, you won't be able to apply for a personal VSC account.
