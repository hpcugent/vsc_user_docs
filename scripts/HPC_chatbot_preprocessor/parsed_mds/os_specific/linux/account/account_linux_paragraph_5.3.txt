Generate a public/private key pair with OpenSSH
A key pair might already be present in the default location inside your
home directory. Therefore, we first check if a key is available with the
"list short" ("ls") command:
ls ~/.ssh
If a key-pair is already available, you would normally get:
authorized_keys     id_rsa      id_rsa.pub      known_hosts
Otherwise, the command will show:
ls: .ssh: No such file or directory
You can recognise a public/private key pair when a pair of files has the
same name except for the extension ".pub" added to one of them. In this
particular case, the private key is "id_rsa" and public key is
"id_rsa.pub". You may have multiple keys (not necessarily in the
directory "~/.ssh") if you or your operating system requires this. Be
aware that your existing key pair might be too short, or not the right
type.
