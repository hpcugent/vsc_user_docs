Applying for the account
Visit https://account.vscentrum.be/
You will be redirected to our WAYF (Where Are You From) service where
you have to select your "Home Organisation".
Select "UGent" in the dropdown box and optionally select "Save my preference"
and "permanently".
Click "Confirm"
You will now be taken to the authentication page of your institute.
You will now have to log in with CAS using your UGent account.
You either have a login name of maximum 8 characters, or a (non-UGent)
email address if you are an external user. In case of problems with your
UGent password, please visit: https://password.ugent.be/. After
logging in, you may be requested to share your information. Click "Yes,
continue".
After you log in using your UGent login and password, you will be asked to
upload the file that contains your public key, i.e., the file
"id_rsa.pub" which you have generated earlier. Make sure that your
public key is actually accepted for upload, because if it is in a wrong
format, wrong type or too short, then it will be refused.
This file has been stored in the directory "~/.ssh/".
After you have uploaded your public key you will receive an e-mail with
a link to confirm your e-mail address. After confirming your e-mail
address the VSC staff will review and if applicable approve your
account.
