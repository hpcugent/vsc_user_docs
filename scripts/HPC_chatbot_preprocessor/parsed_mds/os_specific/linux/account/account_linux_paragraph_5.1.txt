How do SSH keys work
Launch a terminal from your desktop's application menu and you will see
the bash shell. There are other shells, but most Linux distributions use
bash by default.
Test OpenSSH
Secure Shell (ssh) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data
communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and
other secure network services between two networked computers. In short,
ssh provides a secure connection between 2 computers via insecure
channels (Network, Internet, telephone lines, ...).
"Secure" means that:
1.  the User is authenticated to the System; and
2.  the System is authenticated to the User; and
3.  all data is encrypted during transfer.
