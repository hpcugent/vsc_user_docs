You will need to generate a new key pair, when:
1.  you don't have a key pair yet
2.  you forgot the passphrase protecting your private key
3.  your private key was compromised
4.  your key pair is too short or not the right type
For extra security, the private key itself can be encrypted using a
"passphrase", to prevent anyone from using your private key even when
they manage to copy it. You have to "unlock" the private key by typing
the passphrase. Be sure to never give away your private key, it is
private and should stay private. You should not even copy it to one of
your other machines, instead, you should create a new public/private key
pair for each machine.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
This will ask you for a file name to store the private and public key,
and a passphrase to protect your private key. It needs to be emphasised
that you really should choose the passphrase wisely! The system will ask
you for it every time you want to use the private key that is every time
you want to access the cluster or transfer your files.
Without your key pair, you won't be able to apply for a personal VSC account.
