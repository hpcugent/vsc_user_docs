Getting Connected
Getting Started
Welcome to the "Getting Started" guide. This chapter will lead you through the initial steps of logging into the HPC-UGent infrastructure and submitting your very first job. We'll also walk you through the process step by step using a practical example.
In addition to this chapter, you might find the recording of the Introduction to HPC-UGent training session to be a useful resource.
Before proceeding, read the introduction to HPC to gain an understanding of the HPC-UGent infrastructure and related terminology.
Getting Access
To get access to the HPC-UGent infrastructure, visit Getting an HPC Account.
If you have not used Linux before,
now would be a good time to follow our Linux Tutorial.
A typical workflow looks like this:
1.  Connect to the login nodes 
2.  Transfer your files to the HPC-UGent infrastructure
3.  Optional: compile your code and test it 
4.  Create a job script and submit your job
5.  Wait for job to be executed
6.  Study the results generated by your jobs, either on the cluster or
    after downloading them locally.
We will walk through an illustrative workload to get you started. In this example, our objective is to train a deep learning model for recognizing hand-written digits (MNIST dataset) using TensorFlow;
see the example scripts.
Getting Connected
There are two options to connect
- Using a terminal to connect via SSH (for power users) (see First Time connection to the HPC-UGent infrastructure)
- Using the web portal
Considering your operating system is *,
it is recommended to make use of the ssh command in a terminal to get the most flexibility. 
Assuming you have already generated SSH keys in the previous step (Getting Access), and that they are in a default location, you should now be able to login by running the following command:
ssh vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be
 Warning "User your own VSC account id"
    
    Replace vsc40000 with your VSC account id (see https://account.vscentrum.be)
