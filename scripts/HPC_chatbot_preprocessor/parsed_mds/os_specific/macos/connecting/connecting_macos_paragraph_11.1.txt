    A locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and
    any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user
    interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language
    identifier and a region identifier.
     Note
        If you try to set a non-supported locale, then it will be automatically
        set to the default. Currently the default is en_US.UFT-8 or en_US,
        depending on whether your originally (non-supported) locale was UTF-8 or not.
    Open the .bashrc on your local machine with your favourite editor and
    add the following lines:
    
    $ nano ~/.bashrc
    ...
    export LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    ...
    
     tip "tip: vi"
        To start entering text in vi: move to the place you want to start
        entering text with the arrow keys and type "i" to switch to insert mode. You can easily exit vi by entering: ""ESC" :wq"
        To exit vi without saving your changes, enter ""ESC":q!"
    
    
    or alternatively (if you are not comfortable with the Linux editors),
    again on your local machine:
    
    echo "export LANGUAGE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    
    You can now log out, open a new terminal/shell on your local machine and
    reconnect to the login node, and you should not get these warnings anymore.
