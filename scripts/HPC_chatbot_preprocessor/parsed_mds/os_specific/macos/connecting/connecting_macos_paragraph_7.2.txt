The scp command can also be used to copy files from the cluster to your
local machine. Let us copy the remote file "intro-HPC--Gent.pdf" from your "docs"
subdirectory on the cluster to your local computer.
First, we will confirm that the file is indeed in the "docs"
subdirectory. In the terminal on the login node, enter:
$ cd ~/docs
$ ls -l
total 1536
-rw-r--r-- 1 vsc40000 Sep 11 09:53 intro-HPC--Gent.pdf
Now we will copy the file to the local machine. On the terminal on your
own local computer, enter:
$ scp vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:./docs/intro-HPC--Gent.pdf .
intro-HPC--Gent.pdf 100% 725KB 724.6KB/s 00:01
$ ls -l
total 899
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff 741995 Sep 18 09:53
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff      6 Sep 18 09:37 localfile.txt
The file has been copied from the HPC to your local computer.
It's also possible to copy entire directories (and their contents) with
the -r flag. For example, if we want to copy the local directory
dataset to $VSC_SCRATCH, we can use the following command (assuming
you've created the scratch symlink):
scp -r dataset vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:scratch
If you don't use the -r option to copy a directory, you will run into
the following error:
$ scp dataset vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:scratch
dataset: not a regular file
Using sftp
The SSH File Transfer Protocol (also Secure File Transfer Protocol, or SFTP) is a network protocol that provides file access, file
transfer and file management functionalities over any reliable data
stream. It was designed as an extension of the Secure Shell protocol
(SSH) version 2.0. This protocol assumes that it is run over a secure
channel, such as SSH, that the server has already authenticated the
client, and that the identity of the client user is available to the
protocol.
The sftp is an equivalent of the ftp command, with the difference that
it uses the secure ssh protocol to connect to the clusters.
