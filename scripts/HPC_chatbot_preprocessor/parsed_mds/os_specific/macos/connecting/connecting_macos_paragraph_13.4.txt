Now we will copy the file to the local machine. On the terminal on your
own local computer, enter:
$ scp vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:./docs/intro-HPC--Gent.pdf .
intro-HPC--Gent.pdf 100% 725KB 724.6KB/s 00:01
$ ls -l

-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff      6 Sep 18 09:37 localfile.txt
The file has been copied from the HPC to your local computer.
It's also possible to copy entire directories (and their contents) with
the -r flag. For example, if we want to copy the local directory
dataset to $VSC_SCRATCH, we can use the following command (assuming
you've created the scratch symlink):
scp -r dataset vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:scratch
