Transfer Files tofrom the HPC
Using a GUI (Cyberduck)
Cyberduck is a graphical alternative to the scp command. It can be
installed from <https://cyberduck.io>.
This is the one-time setup you will need to do before connecting:
1.  After starting Cyberduck, the Bookmark tab will show up. To add a
    new bookmark, click on the "+" sign on the bottom left of the
    window. A new window will open.
2.  In the drop-down menu on top, select "SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)".
3.  In the "Server" field, type in login.hpc.ugent.be. In the "Username" field, type in
    your VSC account id (this looks like vsc40000).
4.  Select the location of your SSH private key in the "SSH Private Key" field.
5.  Finally, type in a name for the bookmark in the "Nickname" field and
    close the window by pressing on the red circle in the top left
    corner of the window.
