Connect to the HPC via another terminal, print the working directory (to
make sure you're in the home directory) and check whether the file has
arrived:
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
$ ls -l 
total 1536
drwxrwxr-x 2
drwxrwxr-x 2
drwxrwxr-x 10
-rw-r--r-- 1
$ cat localfile.txt
Hello
The scp command can also be used to copy files from the cluster to your
local machine. Let us copy the remote file "intro-HPC--Gent.pdf" from your "docs"
subdirectory on the cluster to your local computer.
First, we will confirm that the file is indeed in the "docs"
subdirectory. In the terminal on the login node, enter:
$ cd ~/docs
$ ls -l
total 1536
-rw-r--r-- 1 vsc40000 Sep 11 09:53 intro-HPC--Gent.pdf
