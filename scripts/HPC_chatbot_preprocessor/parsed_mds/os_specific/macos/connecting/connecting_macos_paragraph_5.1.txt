First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure
Connect
Open up a terminal and enter the following command to connect to the HPC.
You can open a terminal by navigation to Applications and then Utilities in the finder and open Terminal.app, or enter Terminal in Spotlight Search.
ssh vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be
Here, user vsc40000 wants to make a connection to the "hpcugent" cluster at UGent via the login
node "login.hpc.ugent.be", so replace vsc40000 with your own VSC id in the above command.
The first time you make a connection to the login node, you will be
asked to verify the authenticity of the login node. Please check
Warning message when first connecting to new host on how to do this.
