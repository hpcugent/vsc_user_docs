 tip "tip: Setting your Language right"
    You may encounter a warning message similar to the following one during connecting:
    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    LANGUAGE = (unset),
    LC_ALL = (unset),
    LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",
    LANG = (unset)
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
    or any other error message complaining about the locale.
    This means that the correct "locale" has not yet been properly specified on your local machine. Try:
    LANG=
    LC_COLLATE="C"
    LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="C"
    LC_MONETARY="C"
    LC_NUMERIC="C"
    LC_TIME="C"
    LC_ALL=
    A locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and
    any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user
    interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language
    identifier and a region identifier.
     Note
        If you try to set a non-supported locale, then it will be automatically
        set to the default. Currently the default is en_US.UFT-8 or en_US,
        depending on whether your originally (non-supported) locale was UTF-8 or not.
    Open the .bashrc on your local machine with your favourite editor and
    add the following lines:
    
    $ nano ~/.bashrc
    ...
    export LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
    export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    ...
    
     tip "tip: vi"
        To start entering text in vi: move to the place you want to start
        entering text with the arrow keys and type "i" to switch to insert mode. You can easily exit vi by entering: ""ESC" :wq"
        To exit vi without saving your changes, enter ""ESC":q!"
    
    
    or alternatively (if you are not comfortable with the Linux editors),
    again on your local machine:
    
    echo "export LANGUAGE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LC_ALL=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    echo "export LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"" >> ~/.profile
    
    You can now log out, open a new terminal/shell on your local machine and
    reconnect to the login node, and you should not get these warnings anymore.
