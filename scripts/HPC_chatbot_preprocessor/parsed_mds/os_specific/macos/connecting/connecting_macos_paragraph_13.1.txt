Transfer Files tofrom the HPC
Using scp
Secure copy or SCP is a tool (command) for securely transferring files between a local
host (= your computer) and a remote host (the HPC). It is based on the
Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. The scp command is the equivalent of the cp (i.e.,
copy) command, but can copy files to or from remote machines.
It's easier to copy files directly to $VSC_DATA and $VSC_SCRATCH if
you have symlinks to them in your home directory. See 
the chapter titled "Uploading/downloading/editing files", section "Symlinks for data/scratch" in the intro to Linux
 for how to do this.
Open an additional terminal window and check that you're working on your
local machine.
