A possible error message you can get if you previously saved your
private key somewhere else than the default location
($HOME/.ssh/id_rsa):
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
In this case, use the -i option for the ssh command to specify the
location of your private key. For example:
$ ssh -i /home/example/my_keys
