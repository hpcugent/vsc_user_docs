You will need to generate a new key pair, when:
1.  you don't have a key pair yet
2.  you forgot the passphrase protecting your private key
3.  your private key was compromised
4.  your key pair is too short or not the right type
For extra security, the private key itself can be encrypted using a
"passphrase", to prevent anyone from using your private key even when
they manage to copy it. You have to "unlock" the private key by typing
the passphrase. Be sure to never give away your private key, it is
private and should stay private. You should not even copy it to one of
your other machines, instead, you should create a new public/private key
pair for each machine.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
