Using an SSH agent (optional)
Most recent Unix derivatives include by default an SSH agent 
to keep and manage the user SSH keys. If you use one of these derivatives you must include the new keys into
the SSH manager keyring to be able to connect to the HPC cluster. If
not, SSH client will display an error message (see Connecting) similar to this:
Agent admitted failure to sign using the key. 
Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
This could be fixed using the ssh-add command. You can include the new
private keys' identities in your keyring with:
ssh-add
 tip
    Without extra options ssh-add adds any key located at $HOME/.ssh
    directory, but you can specify the private key location path as
    argument, as example: ssh-add /path/to/my/id_rsa.
Check that your key is available from the keyring with:
ssh-add -l
After these changes the key agent will keep your SSH key to connect to
the clusters as usual.
 tip
    You should execute ssh-add command again if you generate a new SSH
    key.
