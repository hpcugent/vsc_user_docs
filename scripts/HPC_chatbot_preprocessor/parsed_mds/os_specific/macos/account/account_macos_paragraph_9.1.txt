Applying for the account
After you log in using your UGent login and password, you will be asked to
upload the file that contains your public key, i.e., the file
"id_rsa.pub" which you have generated earlier. Make sure that your
public key is actually accepted for upload, because if it is in a wrong
format, wrong type or too short, then it will be refused.
This file has been stored in the directory "~/.ssh/".
 tip
    As ".ssh" is an invisible directory, the Finder will not show it by
    default. The easiest way to access the folder, is by pressing ++cmd+shift+g++ (or ++cmd+shift+"."++),
    which will allow you to enter the name of a directory, which you would
    like to open in Finder. Here, type "~/.ssh" and press enter.
