Computation Workflow on the HPC
Now, you can start using the HPC. You can always look up your VSC id later
by visiting https://account.vscentrum.be.
Adding multiple SSH public keys (optional)
In case you are connecting from different computers to the login nodes,
it is advised to use separate SSH public keys to do so. You should
follow these steps.
1.  Create a new public/private SSH key pair from the new computer.
    Repeat the process described in
    sectionÂ Generate a public/private key pair with OpenSSH.
2.  Go to https://account.vscentrum.be/django/account/edit
3.  Upload the new SSH public key using the Add public key section. Make sure that your
    public key is actually saved, because a public key will be refused
    if it is too short, wrong type, or in a wrong format.
4.  (optional) If you lost your key, you can delete the old key on the
    same page. You should keep at least one valid public SSH key in your
    account.
5.  Take into account that it will take some time before the new SSH
    public key is active in your account on the system; waiting for
    15-30 minutes should be sufficient.
Computation Workflow on the HPC
A typical Computation workflow will be:
1.  Connect to the HPC
2.  Transfer your files to the HPC
3.  Compile your code and test it
4.  Create a job script
5.  Submit your job
6.  Wait while
    1.  your job gets into the queue
    2.  your job gets executed
    3.  your job finishes
7.  Move your results
We'll take you through the different tasks one by one in the following
chapters.
