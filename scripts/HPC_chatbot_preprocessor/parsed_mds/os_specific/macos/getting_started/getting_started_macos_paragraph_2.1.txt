Transfer your files
Now that you can login, it is time to transfer files from your local computer to your home directory on the HPC-UGent infrastructure.
Download tensorflow_mnist.py 
and run.sh example scripts to your computer (from here).
On your local machine you can run:
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcugent/vsc_user_docs/main/mkdocs/docs/HPC/examples/Getting_Started/tensorflow_mnist/tensorflow_mnist.py
curl -OL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcugent/vsc_user_docs/main/mkdocs/docs/HPC/examples/Getting_Started/tensorflow_mnist/run.sh
Using the scp command, the files can be copied from your local host to your home directory (~) on the remote host (HPC).
scp tensorflow_mnist.py run.sh vsc40000login.hpc.ugent.be:~
ssh  vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be
 Warning "User your own VSC account id"
    
    Replace vsc40000 with your VSC account id (see https://account.vscentrum.be)
 Info
    For more information about transfering files or scp, see tranfer files from/to hpc.
When running ls in your session on the HPC-UGent infrastructure, you should see the two files listed in your home directory (~):
$ ls ~
run.sh tensorflow_mnist.py
When you do not see these files, make sure you uploaded the files to your home directory.
Submitting a job
Jobs are submitted and executed using job scripts. In our case run.sh can be used as a (very minimal) job script.
A job script is a shell script, a text file that specifies the resources, 
the software that is used (via module load statements), 
and the steps that should be executed to run the calculation.
