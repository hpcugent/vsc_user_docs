 Info
    When having problems see the connection issues section on the troubleshooting page.
Transfer your files
Now that you can login, it is time to transfer files from your local computer to your home directory on the HPC-UGent infrastructure.
Download tensorflow_mnist.py 
and run.sh example scripts to your computer (from here).
The HPC-UGent web portal provides a file browser that allows uploading files.
For more information see the file browser section.
Upload both files (run.sh and tensorflow-mnist.py) to your home directory and go back to your shell.
 Info
    As an alternative, you can use WinSCP (see our section)
When running ls in your session on the HPC-UGent infrastructure, you should see the two files listed in your home directory (~):
$ ls ~
run.sh tensorflow_mnist.py
When you do not see these files, make sure you uploaded the files to your home directory.
Submitting a job
Jobs are submitted and executed using job scripts. In our case run.sh can be used as a (very minimal) job script.
A job script is a shell script, a text file that specifies the resources, 
the software that is used (via module load statements), 
and the steps that should be executed to run the calculation.
