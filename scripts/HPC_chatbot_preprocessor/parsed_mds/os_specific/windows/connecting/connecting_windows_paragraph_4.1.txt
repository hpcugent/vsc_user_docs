First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure
Open a Terminal
You've generated a public/private key pair with PuTTYgen and have an
approved account on the VSC clusters. The next step is to setup the
connection to (one of) the HPC.
In the screenshots, we show the setup for user
to the HPC cluster via the login node "login.hpc.ugent.be".
1.  Start the PuTTY executable putty.exe in your directory
    C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY and the configuration screen will pop
    up. As you will often use the PuTTY tool, we recommend adding a
    shortcut on your desktop.
2.  Within the category <Session\>, in the field <Host Name\>, enter the name of the
    login node of the cluster (i.e., "login.hpc.ugent.be") you want to connect to.
    
3.  In the category "Connection > Data", in the field "Auto-login username", put in <vsc40000\> , which is your VSC
    username that you have received by e-mail after your request was
    approved.
    
4.  In the category "Connection > SSH > Auth", in the field "Private key file for authentication" click on "Browse" and select the private key
    (i.e., "id_rsa.ppk") that you generated and saved above.
5.  In the category "Connection > SSH > X11", click the "Enable X11 Forwarding" checkbox.
6.  Now go back to <Session\>, and fill in "hpcugent" in the "Saved Sessions" field and press "Save" to
    store the session information.
    
7.  Now pressing "Open", will open a terminal window and asks for you
    passphrase.
    
8.  If this is your first time connecting, you will be asked to verify
    the authenticity of the login node. Please see
    section Warning message when first connecting to new host
    on how to do this.
9.  After entering your correct passphrase, you will be connected to the
    login-node of the HPC.
10. To check you can now "Print the Working Directory" (pwd) and check
    the name of the computer, where you have logged in (hostname):
        $ pwd
    /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
    $ hostname -f
    gligar07.gastly.os
    
11. For future PuTTY sessions, just select your saved session (i.e. "hpcugent")
    from the list, "Load" it and press "Open".
