First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure
Congratulations, you're on the HPC infrastructure now!
To find out where you have landed you can print the current working directory:
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
Your new private home directory is "/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000". Here you can create your own
subdirectory structure, copy and prepare your applications, compile and
test them and submit your jobs on the HPC.
$ cd /apps/gent/tutorials
$ ls
Intro-HPC/
This directory currently contains all training material for the Introduction to the HPC. More
relevant training material to work with the HPC can always be added later in
this directory.
You can now explore the content of this directory with the "ls --l" (lists long) and the "cd" (change directory) commands:
As we are interested in the use of the HPC, move further to Intro-HPC and explore the
contents up to 2 levels deep:
$ cd Intro-HPC
$ tree -L 2
