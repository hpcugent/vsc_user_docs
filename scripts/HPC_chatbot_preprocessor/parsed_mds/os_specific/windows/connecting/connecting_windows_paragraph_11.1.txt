    A locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and
    any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user
    interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language
    identifier and a region identifier.
     Note
        If you try to set a non-supported locale, then it will be automatically
        set to the default. Currently the default is en_US.UFT-8 or en_US,
        depending on whether your originally (non-supported) locale was UTF-8 or not.
