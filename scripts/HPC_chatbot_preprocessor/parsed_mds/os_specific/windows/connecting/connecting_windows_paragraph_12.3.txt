Note: it is possible that the ssh-ed25519 fingerprint starts with ssh-ed25519 255
rather than ssh-ed25519 256 (or vice versa), depending on the PuTTY version you are using.
It is safe to ignore this 255 versus 256 difference, but the part after should be
identical.
Now, try out whether you can transfer an arbitrary file from your local
machine to the HPC and back.
