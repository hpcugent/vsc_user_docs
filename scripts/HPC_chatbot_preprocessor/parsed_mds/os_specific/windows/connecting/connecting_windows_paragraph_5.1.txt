 tip "tip: Setting your Language right"
    You may encounter a warning message similar to the following one during connecting:
    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    LANGUAGE = (unset),
    LC_ALL = (unset),
    LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",
    LANG = (unset)
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
    or any other error message complaining about the locale.
    This means that the correct "locale" has not yet been properly specified on your local machine. Try:
    LANG=
    LC_COLLATE="C"
    LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="C"
    LC_MONETARY="C"
    LC_NUMERIC="C"
    LC_TIME="C"
    LC_ALL=
    A locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country and
    any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user
    interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language
    identifier and a region identifier.
     Note
        If you try to set a non-supported locale, then it will be automatically
        set to the default. Currently the default is en_US.UFT-8 or en_US,
        depending on whether your originally (non-supported) locale was UTF-8 or not.
