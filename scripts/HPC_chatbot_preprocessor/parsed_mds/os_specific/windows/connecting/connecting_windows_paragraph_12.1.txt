Transfer Files to/from the HPC
Before you can do some work, you'll have to transfer the files you need from your desktop or department to the cluster. At the end of a job, you might want to transfer some files back.
WinSCP
To transfer files to and from the cluster, we recommend the use of
WinSCP, a graphical file management tool which can transfer files using
secure protocols such as SFTP and SCP. WinSCP is freely available from
<http://www.winscp.net>.
To transfer your files using WinSCP,
1.  Open the program
2.  The "Login" menu is shown automatically (if it is closed, click "New Session" to open it again). Fill in the necessary fields under "Session"
    1.  Click "New Site".
    2.  Enter "login.hpc.ugent.be" in the "Host name" field.
    3.  Enter your "vsc-account" in the "User name" field.
    4.  Select "SCP" as the "file" protocol.
    5.  Note that the password field remains empty.
    
    6.  Click "Advanced...".
    7.  Click "SSH > Authentication".
    8.  Select your private key in the field "Private key file".
3.  Press the "Save" button, to save the session under "Session > Sites" for future access.
4.  Finally, when clicking on "Login", you will be asked for your key passphrase.
