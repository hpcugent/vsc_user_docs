Copying files with WinSCP
After copying files from a windows machine, a file might look funny when
looking at it on the cluster.
$ cat script.sh
#!/bin/bash^M
#PBS -l nodes^M
...
Or you can get errors like:
$ qsub fibo.pbs
qsub: script is written in DOS/Windows text format
See section dos2unix to fix these errors with dos2unix.
Permissions
$ ls -l script.sh # File with correct permissions
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 2983 Jan 30 09:13 script.sh
$ ls -l script.sh # File with incorrect permissions
-rw-r--r-- 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 2983 Jan 30 09:13 script.sh
Before submitting the script, you'll need to add execute permissions to
make sure it can be executed:
$ chmod +x script_name.sh
Help
If you stumble upon an error, don't panic! Read the error output, it
might contain a clue as to what went wrong. You can copy the error
message into Google (selecting a small part of the error without
filenames). It can help if you surround your search terms in double
quotes (for example "No such file or directory"), that way Google will
consider the error as one thing, and won't show results just containing
these words in random order.
If you need help about a certain command, you should consult its so-called "man page":
$ man command
This will open the manual of this command. This manual contains detailed
explanation of all the options the command has. Exiting the manual is
done by pressing 'q'.
