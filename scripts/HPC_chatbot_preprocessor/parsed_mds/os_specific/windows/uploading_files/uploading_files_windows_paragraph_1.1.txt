dos2unix
[//]: # (subsec:dos2unix)
After uploading files from Windows, you may experience some problems due to the difference
in line endings between Windows (carriage return + line feed) and Linux (line feed only),
see also https://kuantingchen04.github.io/line-endings/.
For example, you may see an error when submitting a job script that was edited on Windows:
sbatch: error: Batch script contains DOS line breaks (\r\n)
sbatch: error: instead of expected UNIX line breaks (\n).
To fix this problem, you should run the dos2unix command on the file:
$ dos2unix filename
Symlinks for data/scratch
[//]: # (sec:symlink-for-data)
As we end up in the home directory when connecting, it would be
convenient if we could access our data and VO storage. To facilitate
this we will create symlinks to them in our home directory. 
This will create 4 symbolic links 
(they're like "shortcuts" on your desktop and they look like directories in WinSCP)
 pointing to the respective storages:
$ cd $HOME
$ ln -s $VSC_SCRATCH scratch
$ ln -s $VSC_DATA data
$ ls -l scratch data
lrwxrwxrwx 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 31 Mar 27 2009 data ->
    /user/data/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
lrwxrwxrwx 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 34 Jun 5 2012 scratch ->
    /user/scratch/gent/vsc400/vsc40000
 
 Editing with nano
Nano is the simplest editor available on Linux. To open Nano, just type
nano. To edit a file, you use nano the_file_to_edit.txt. You will be
presented with the contents of the file and a menu at the bottom with
commands like ^O Write Out The ^ is the Control key. So ^O means
Ctrl-O. The main commands are:
1.  Open ("Read"): ^R
2.  Save ("Write Out"): ^O
3.  Exit: ^X
