Using an SSH agent (optional)
It is possible to setup a SSH agent in Windows. This is an optional
configuration to help you to keep all your SSH keys (if you have
several) stored in the same key ring to avoid to type the SSH key
password each time. The SSH agent is also necessary to enable SSH hops
with key forwarding from Windows.
Pageant is the SSH authentication agent used in windows. This agent should be
available from the PuTTY installation package
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html> or as
stand alone binary package.
After the installation just start the Pageant application in Windows,
this will start the agent in background. The agent icon will be visible
from the Windows panel.
