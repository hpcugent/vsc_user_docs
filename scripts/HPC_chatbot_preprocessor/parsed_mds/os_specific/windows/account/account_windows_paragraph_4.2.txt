The PuTTY package consists of several components, but we'll only use
two:
1. PuTTY: the Telnet and SSH client itself (to login, see Open a terminal)
2.  PuTTYgen: an RSA and DSA key generation utility (to generate a key pair,
    see Generate a public/private key pair)
Generating a public/private key pair
Before requesting a VSC account, you need to generate a pair of ssh
keys. You need 2 keys, a public and a private key. You can visualise the
public key as a lock to which only you have the key (your private key).
You can send a copy of your lock to anyone without any problems, because
only you can open it, as long as you keep your private key secure. To
generate a public/private key pair, you can use the PuTTYgen key
generator.
