How do SSH keys work
A typical Windows environment does not come with pre-installed software
to connect and run command-line executables on a HPC. Some tools need to be
installed on your Windows machine first, before we can start the actual
work.
Get PuTTY: A free telnet/SSH client
We recommend to use the PuTTY tools package, which is freely available.
You do not need to install PuTTY, you can download the PuTTY and
PuTTYgen executable and run it. This can be useful in situations where
you do not have the required permissions to install software on the
computer you are using. Alternatively, an installation package is also
available.
You can download PuTTY from the official address:
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>. You
probably want the 64-bits version. If you can install software on your
computer, you can use the "Package files", if not, you can download and
use putty.exe and puttygen.exe in the "Alternative binary files"
section.
