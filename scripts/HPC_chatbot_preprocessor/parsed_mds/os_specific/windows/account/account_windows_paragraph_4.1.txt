Using an SSH agent (optional)
It is possible to setup a SSH agent in Windows. This is an optional
configuration to help you to keep all your SSH keys (if you have
several) stored in the same key ring to avoid to type the SSH key
password each time. The SSH agent is also necessary to enable SSH hops
with key forwarding from Windows.
Pageant is the SSH authentication agent used in windows. This agent should be
available from the PuTTY installation package
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html or as
stand alone binary package.
After the installation just start the Pageant application in Windows,
this will start the agent in background. The agent icon will be visible
from the Windows panel.
At this point the agent does not contain any private key. You should
include the private key(s) generated in the previous section Generating a public/private key pair.
1.  Click on "Add key"
2.  Select the private key file generated in Generating a public/private key pair ("id_rsa.ppk" by default).
3.  Enter the same SSH key password used to generate the key. After this
    step the new key will be included in Pageant to manage the SSH
    connections.
4.  You can see the SSH key(s) available in the key ring just clicking
    on "View Keys".
5.  You can change PuTTY setup to use the SSH agent. Open PuTTY and check
    Connection > SSH > Auth > Allow agent forwarding.
Now you can connect to the login nodes as usual. The SSH agent will know
which SSH key should be used and you do not have to type the SSH
passwords each time, this task is done by Pageant agent automatically.
It is also possible to use WinSCP with Pageant, see
https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_pageant for more details.
