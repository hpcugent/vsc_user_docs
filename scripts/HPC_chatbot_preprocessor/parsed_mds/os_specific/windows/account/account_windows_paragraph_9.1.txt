Applying for the account
After you log in using your UGent login and password, you will be asked to
upload the file that contains your public key, i.e., the file
"id_rsa.pub" which you have generated earlier. Make sure that your
public key is actually accepted for upload, because if it is in a wrong
format, wrong type or too short, then it will be refused.
This file should have been stored in the directory
"C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\PuTTY\\.ssh"
