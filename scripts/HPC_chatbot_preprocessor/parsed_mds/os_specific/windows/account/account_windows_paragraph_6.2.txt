At this point the agent does not contain any private key. You should
include the private key(s) generated in the previous section Generating a public/private key pair.
1.  Click on "Add key"
2.  Select the private key file generated in Generating a public/private key pair ("id_rsa.ppk" by default).
3.  Enter the same SSH key password used to generate the key. After this
    step the new key will be included in Pageant to manage the SSH
    connections.
4.  You can see the SSH key(s) available in the key ring just clicking
    on "View Keys".
5.  You can change PuTTY setup to use the SSH agent. Open PuTTY and check
    Connection > SSH > Auth > Allow agent forwarding.
