Start PuTTYgen.exe it and follow these steps:
1.  In "Parameters" (at the bottom of the window), choose "RSA" and set the number of
    bits in the key to 4096.
2.  Click on "Generate". To generate the key, you must move the mouse cursor over
    the PuTTYgen window (this generates some random data that PuTTYgen
    uses to generate the key pair). Once the key pair is generated, your
    public key is shown in the field "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file".
3.  Next, it is advised to fill in the "Key comment" field to make it easier
    identifiable afterwards.
4.  Next, you should specify a passphrase in the "Key passphrase" field and retype it in
    the "Confirm passphrase" field. Remember, the passphrase protects the private key against
    unauthorised use, so it is best to choose one that is not too easy
    to guess but that you can still remember. Using a passphrase is not
    required, but we recommend you to use a good passphrase unless you
    are certain that your computer's hard disk is encrypted with a
    decent password. (If you are not sure your disk is encrypted, it
    probably isn't.)
5.  Save both the public and private keys in a folder on your personal
    computer (We recommend to create and put them in the folder
    "C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\PuTTY\\.ssh") with the
    buttons "Save public key" and "Save private key". We recommend using the name "id_rsa.pub" for the public key, and
    "id_rsa.ppk" for the private key.
6.  Finally, save an "OpenSSH" version of your private key (in
    particular for later "X2Go" usage, see x2go) by entering the
    "Conversions" menu and selecting "Export OpenSSH key" (do not select the
    "force new file format" variant). Save the file in the same location
    as in the previous step with filename "id_rsa". (If there is no
    "Conversions" menu, you must update your "puttygen" version. If you
    want to do this conversion afterwards, you can start with loading an
    existing "id_rsa.ppk" and only do this conversions export.)
