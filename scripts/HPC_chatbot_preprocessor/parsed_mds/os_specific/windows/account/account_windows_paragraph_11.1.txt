Adding multiple SSH public keys (optional)
In case you are connecting from different computers to the login nodes,
it is advised to use separate SSH public keys to do so. You should
follow these steps.
1.  Create a new public/private SSH key pair from Putty. Repeat the
    process described in
    sectionÂ Generate a public/private key pair.
2.  Go to <https://account.vscentrum.be/django/account/edit>
3.  Upload the new SSH public key using the Add public key section. Make sure that your
    public key is actually saved, because a public key will be refused
    if it is too short, wrong type, or in a wrong format.
4.  (optional) If you lost your key, you can delete the old key on the
    same page. You should keep at least one valid public SSH key in your
    account.
5.  Take into account that it will take some time before the new SSH
    public key is active in your account on the system; waiting for
    15-30 minutes should be sufficient.
