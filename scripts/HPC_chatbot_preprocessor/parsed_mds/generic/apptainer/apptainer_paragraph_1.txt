Apptainer (formally known as Singularity)
What is Apptainer?
Apptainer is an open-source computer program that performs
operating-system-level virtualization (also known as containerisation).
One of the main uses of Apptainer is to bring containers and
reproducibility to scientific computing and the high-performance
computing (HPC) world. Using Apptainer/Singularity containers,
developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and
design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and
executed on other platforms.
For more general information about the use of Apptainer, please see the
official documentation at https://apptainer.org/docs/.
This documentation only covers aspects of using Apptainer on the
HPC-UGent infrastructure infrastructure.
Restrictions on image location
Some restrictions have been put in place on the use of Apptainer. This
is mainly done for performance reasons and to avoid that the use of
Apptainer impacts other users on the system.
The Apptainer/Singularity image file must be located on either one of
the scratch filesystems, the local disk of the workernode you are using
or /dev/shm. The centrally provided apptainer command will refuse to
run using images that are located elsewhere, in particular on the
$VSC_HOME, /apps or $VSC_DATA filesystems.
In addition, this implies that running containers images provided via a
URL (e.g., shub://... or docker://...) will not work.
If these limitations are a problem for you, please let us know via hpc@ugent.be.
Available filesystems
All HPC-UGent shared filesystems will be readily available in an
Apptainer/Singularity container, including the home, data and scratch
filesystems, and they will be accessible via the familiar $VSC_HOME,
$VSC_DATA* and $VSC_SCRATCH* environment variables.
Apptainer/Singularity Images
Creating Apptainer/Singularity images
Creating new Apptainer/Singularity images or converting Docker images,
by default, requires admin privileges, which is obviously not available
on the HPC-UGent infrastructure infrastructure. However, if you use the --fakeroot option, you
can make new Apptainer/Singularity images or convert Docker images.
Due to the nature of --fakeroot option, we recommend to write your
Apptainer/Singularity image to a globally writable location, like
/tmp, or /local directories. Once the image is created, you should
move it to your desired destination. An example to make an
Apptainer/Singularity container image:
