Please note that based on the (historical) workload of the interactive
and debug cluster, the above restrictions and the overcommitment ratio
might change without prior notice.
Shared GPUs
Each node in the donphan cluster has a relatively small GPU that is shared between all jobs.
This means that you don't need to reserve it and thus possibly wait for it.
But this also has a downside for performance and security: jobs might be competing for the same GPU resources (cores, memory or encoders) without
any preset fairshare and there is no guarantee one job cannot access another job's memory
(as opposed to having reserved GPUs in the GPU clusters).
All software should behave the same as on the dedicated GPU clusters (e.g. using CUDA or OpenGL acceleration
from a cluster desktop via the webportal).
