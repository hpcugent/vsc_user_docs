Easybuild
What is Easybuild?
You can use EasyBuild to build and install supported software in your
own VSC account, rather than requesting a central installation by the
HPC support team.
EasyBuild (https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild) is the software
build and installation framework that was created by the HPC-UGent team,
and has recently been picked up by HPC sites around the world. It allows
you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC)
systems in an efficient way.
When should I use Easybuild?
For general software installation requests, please see I want to use software that is not available on the clusters yet. However, there
might be reasons to install the software yourself:
-   applying custom patches to the software that only you or your group
    are using
-   evaluating new software versions prior to requesting a central
    software installation
-   installing (very) old software versions that are no longer eligible
    for central installation (on new clusters)
Configuring EasyBuild
Before you use EasyBuild, you need to configure it:
Path to sources
This is where EasyBuild can find software sources:
EASYBUILD_SOURCEPATH=$VSC_DATA/easybuild/sources:/apps/gent/source
-   the first directory $VSC_DATA/easybuild/sources is where EasyBuild
    will (try to) automatically download sources if they're not
    available yet
-   /apps/gent/source is the central "cache" for already downloaded
    sources, and will be considered by EasyBuild before downloading
    anything
Build directory
This directory is where EasyBuild will build software in. To have good
performance, this needs to be on a fast filesystem.
export EASYBUILD_BUILDPATH=${TMPDIR:-/tmp/$USER}
On cluster nodes, you can use the fast, in-memory /dev/shm/$USER
location as a build directory.
Software install location
This is where EasyBuild will install the software (and accompanying
modules) to.
For example, to let it use $VSC_DATA/easybuild, use:
export EASYBUILD_INSTALLPATH=$VSC_DATA/easybuild/$VSC_OS_LOCAL/$VSC_ARCH_LOCAL$VSC_ARCH_SUFFIX
Using the $VSC_OS_LOCAL, $VSC_ARCH and $VSC_ARCH_SUFFIX
environment variables ensures that your install software to a location
that is specific to the cluster you are building for.
