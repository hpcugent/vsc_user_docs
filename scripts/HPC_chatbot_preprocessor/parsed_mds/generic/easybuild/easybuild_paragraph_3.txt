Install other software
To install other, not yet supported, software, you will need to provide
the required easyconfig files yourself. See
https://easybuild.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Writing_easyconfig_files.html
for more information.
Using the installed modules
To use the modules you installed with EasyBuild, extend $MODULEPATH to
make them accessible for loading:
module use $EASYBUILD_INSTALLPATH/modules/all
It makes sense to put this module use command and all export
commands in your .bashrc login script.
That way, you don't have to type
these commands every time you want to use EasyBuild or you want to load
modules generated with EasyBuild.
