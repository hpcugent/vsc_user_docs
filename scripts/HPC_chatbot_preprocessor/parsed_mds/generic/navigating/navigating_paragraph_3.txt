The default permission settings for new files/directories are determined
by the so-called umask setting, and are by default:
1.  read-write permission on files for user/group (no execute),
    read-only for others (no write/execute)
2.  read-write-execute permission for directories on user/group,
    read/execute-only for others (no write)
See also the chmod command
later in this manual.
Finding files/directories: "find"
find will crawl a series of directories and lists files
matching given criteria.
For example, to look for the file named one.txt: 
$ cd $HOME 
$ find . -name one.txt
./some_directory/one.txt 
To look for files using incomplete names, you can use a wildcard
; note that you need to escape the  to
avoid that Bash expands it into afile.txt by adding
double quotes: 
$ find . -name "*.txt"
./.hidden_file.txt 
./afile.txt 
./some_directory/one.txt
./some_directory/two.txt 
A more advanced use of the find command is to use the
-exec flag to perform actions on the found file(s), rather
than just printing their paths (see man find).
Exercises
-   Go to /tmp, then back to your home directory. How many
    different ways to do this can you come up with?
-   When was your home directory created or last changed?
-   Determine the name of the last changed file in /tmp.
-   See how home directories are organised. Can you access the home
    directory of other users?
The next chapter will teach
you how to interact with files and directories.
