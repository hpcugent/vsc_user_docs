If you try to use ls on a file that doesn't exist, you
will get a clear error message: 
$ ls nosuchfile 
ls: cannot access nosuchfile: No such file or directory
Changing directory: "cd"
To change to a different directory, you can use the cd
command: 
$ cd some_directory
To change back to the previous directory you were in, there's a
shortcut: cd -
Using cd without an argument results in returning back to
your home directory: 
$ cd 
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000 
Inspecting file type: "file"
The file command can be used to inspect what type of file
you're dealing with: 
$ file afile.txt
afile.txt: ASCII text
$ file some_directory 
some_directory: directory
Absolute vs relative file paths
An absolute filepath starts with / (or a variable which
value starts with /), which is also called the root of
the filesystem.
Example: absolute path to your home directory:
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000.
A relative path starts from the current directory, and points to
another location up or down the filesystem hierarchy.
Example: some_directory/one.txt points to the file
one.txt that is located in the subdirectory named
some_directory of the current directory.
There are two special relative paths worth mentioning:
-   . is a shorthand for the current directory
-   .. is a shorthand for the parent of the current
    directory
You can also use .. when constructing relative paths, for
example: 
$ cd $HOME/some_directory 
$ ls ../afile.txt 
../afile.txt 
Permissions
[//]: # (sec:permissions)
Each file and directory has particular permissions set on it, which
can be queried using ls -l.
For example: 
$ ls -l afile.txt 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 vsc40000 agroup 2929176 Apr 12 13:29 afile.txt 
The -rwxrw-r-- specifies both the type of file
(- for files, d for directories (see first
character)), and the permissions for user/group/others:
1.  each triple of characters indicates whether the read
    (r), write (w), execute
    (x) permission bits are set or not
2.  the 1st part rwx indicates that the owner
    "vsc40000" of the file has all the rights
3.  the 2nd part rw- indicates the members of the group
    "agroup" only have read/write permissions (not execute)
4.  the 3rd part r-- indicates that other users only
    have read permissions
