Note that:
1.  the parameter values 20, 1.05, 4.3 have been replaced by variables
    $temperature, $pressure and $volume respectively, which were
    being specified on the first line of the "data.csv" file;
2.  the number of processors per node has been increased to 8 (i.e.,
    ppn=1 is replaced by ppn=8);
3.  the walltime has been increased to 4 hours (i.e., walltime=00:15:00
    is replaced by walltime=04:00:00).
The walltime is calculated as follows: one calculation takes 15 minutes,
so 100 calculations take 1500 minutes on one CPU. However, this job will
use 8 CPUs, so the 100 calculations will be done in 1500/8 = 187.5
minutes, i.e., 4 hours to be on the safe side.
The job can now be submitted as follows (to check which worker module
to use, see subsection Using explicit version numbers):
$ module load worker/1.6.12-foss-2021b
$ wsub -batch weather.pbs -data data.csv
total number of work items: 41
123456
Note that the PBS file is the value of the -batch option. The weather
program will now be run for all 100 parameter instances -- 8
concurrently -- until all computations are done. A computation for such
a parameter instance is called a work item in Worker parlance.
 warning
    When you attempt to submit a worker job on a non-default cluster, you might encounter an Illegal instruction error. In such cases, the solution is to use a different module swap command. For example, to submit a worker job to the donphan debug cluster from the login nodes, use:
    
    module swap env/slurm/donphan
    instead of
        
    module swap cluster/donphan
    We recommend using a module swap cluster command after submitting the jobs. Additional information about this as well as more comprehensive details concerning the 'Illegal instruction' error can be accessed here.
