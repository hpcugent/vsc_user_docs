More on the HPC infrastructure
Filesystems
Multiple different shared filesystems are available on the HPC
infrastructure, each with their own purpose. See section
Where to store your data on the HPC
for a list of available locations.
VO storage
If you are a member of a (non-default) virtual organisation (VO), see section
Virtual Organisations,
you have access to additional directories (with more quota) on the data and
scratch filesystems, which you can share with other members in the VO.
Quota
Space is limited on the cluster's storage. To check your quota, see section
Pre-defined quota.
To figure out where your quota is being spent, the du (isk sage)
command can come in useful:
$ du -sh test
59M test
Do not (frequently) run du on directories where large amounts of
data are stored, since that will:
1.  take a long time
2.  result in increased load on the shared storage since (the metadata
    of) every file in those directories will have to be inspected.
Modules
Software is provided through so-called environment modules.
The most commonly used commands are:
1.  module avail: show all available modules
2.  module avail <software name>: show available modules for a
    specific software name
3.  module list: show list of loaded modules
4.  module load <module name>: load a particular module
More information is available in section
Modules.
Using the clusters
The use the clusters beyond the login node(s) which have limited resources, you
should create job scripts and submit them to the clusters.
Detailed information is available in section
submitting your job.
Exercises
Create and submit a job script that computes the sum of 1-100 using
Python, and prints the numbers to a unique output file in
$VSC_SCRATCH.
Hint: python -c "print(sum(range(1, 101)))"
