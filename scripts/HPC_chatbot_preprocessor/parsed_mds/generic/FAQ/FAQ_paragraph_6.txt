Is my connection compromised? Remote host identification has changed
On Monday 25 April 2022, the login nodes received an update to RHEL8.
This means that the host keys of those servers also changed. As a result,
you could encounter the following warnings.
MacOS & Linux (on Windows, only the second part is shown):
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
xx:xx:xx.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/hostname/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /var/lib/sss/pubconf/known_hosts:1
RSA host key for user has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
Please follow the instructions at migration to RHEL8
to ensure it really is not a hacking attempt \- you will find the correct host key to compare.
You will also find how to hide the warning.
