Modules from the same toolchain always work together, and modules from a
\*different version of the same toolchain\* never work together.
The above set of modules works together: an overview of compatible toolchains can be found here:
https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/Common-toolchains.html#overview-of-common-toolchains.
You can use module avail [search_text] to see which versions on which toolchains are available to use.
If you need something that's not available yet, you can request it through a
software installation request.
It is possible to use the modules without specifying a version or toolchain. However,
this will probably cause incompatible modules to be loaded. Don't do it if you use multiple modules.
Even if it works now, as more modules get installed on the HPC, your job can suddenly break.
Troubleshooting
My modules don't work together
When incompatible modules are loaded, you might encounter an error like this:
Lmod has detected the following error: A different version of the 'GCC' module
is already loaded (see output of 'ml').
You should load another foss module for that is compatible with the currently
loaded version of GCC.
Use ml spider foss to get an overview of the available versions.
Modules from the same toolchain always work together, and modules from a
_different version of the same toolchain_ never work together.

My job takes longer than 72 hours
The 72 hour walltime limit will not be extended. However, you can work around this barrier:
* Check that all available resources are being used. See also:
    * How many cores/nodes should I request?.
    * My job is slow.
    * My job isn't using any GPUs.
* Use a faster cluster.
* Divide the job into more parallel processes.
* Divide the job into shorter processes, which you can submit as separate jobs.
* Use the built-in checkpointing of your software.
