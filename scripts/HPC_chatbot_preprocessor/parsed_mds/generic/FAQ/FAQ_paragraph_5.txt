#!/bin/bash 
echo "hello world"
And we run it like mympirun ./hello.sh --output output.txt.
To our surprise, this doesn't output to the file output.txt, but to
standard out! This is because mympirun expects the program name and
the arguments of the program to be its last arguments. Here, the
--output output.txt arguments are passed to ./hello.sh instead of to
mympirun. The correct way to run it is:
mympirun --output output.txt ./hello.sh

Why do I get a "No space left on device" error, while I still have storage space left?
When trying to create files, errors like this can occur:
No space left on device
The error "No space left on device" can mean two different things:
- all available storage quota on the file system in question has been used;
- the inode limit has been reached on that file system.
An inode can be seen as a "file slot", meaning that when the limit is reached, no more additional files can be created.
There is a standard inode limit in place that will be increased if needed. 
The number of inodes used per file system can be checked on the VSC account page.
Possible solutions to this problem include cleaning up unused files and directories or 
compressing directories with a lot of files into zip- or tar-files.
If the problem persists, feel free to contact support.

Can I share my account with someone else?
NO. You are not allowed to share your VSC account with anyone else, it is
strictly personal. 
See
https://helpdesk.ugent.be/account/en/regels.php. 
If you want to share data, there are alternatives (like a shared directories in VO
space, see Virtual organisations).
Can I share my data with other HPC users?
Yes, you can use the chmod or setfacl commands to change permissions
of files so other users can access the data. For example, the following
command will enable a user named "otheruser" to read the file named
dataset.txt. See
