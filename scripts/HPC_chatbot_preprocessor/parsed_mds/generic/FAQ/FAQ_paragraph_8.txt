You can get more storage space through a Virtual Organisation (VO),
which will give you access to the additional directories in a subdirectory specific to that VO ($VSC_DATA_VO and $VSC_SCRATCH_VO).
The moderators of a VO can request more storage for their VO.
Why can't I use the sudo command?
When you attempt to use sudo, you will be prompted for a password. 
However, you cannot enter a valid password because this feature is reserved exclusively for HPC administrators.
sudo is used to execute a command with administrator rights, which would allow you to make system-wide changes.
You are only able to run commands that make changes to the directories that your VSC account has access to,
like your home directory, your personal directories like $VSC_DATA and $VSC_SCRATCH, 
or shared VO/group directories like $VSC_DATA_VO and $VSC_SCRATCH_VO.
A lot of tasks can be performed without sudo, including installing software in your own account.
Installing software
- If you know how to install the software without using sudo, you are welcome to proceed with the installation.
- If you are unsure how to install the software, you can submit a software installation request, and the HPC-UGent support team will handle the installation for you.
