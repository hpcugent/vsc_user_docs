Manipulating files and directories
Being able to manage your data is an important part of using the HPC
infrastructure. The bread and butter commands for doing this are
mentioned here. It might seem annoyingly terse at first, but with
practice you will realise that it's very practical to have such common
commands short to type.
File contents: "cat", "head", "tail", "less", "more"
To print the contents of an entire file, you can use cat; to only see
the first or last N lines, you can use head or tail:
$ cat one.txt
1
2
3
4
5
$ head -2 one.txt
1
2
$ tail -2 one.txt
4
5
To check the contents of long text files, you can use the less or
more commands which support scrolling with "&lt;up&gt;", "&lt;down&gt;",
"&lt;space&gt;", etc.
Copying files: "cp"
$ cp source target
This is the cp command, which copies a file from source to target. To
copy a directory, we use the -r option:
$ cp -r sourceDirectory target
A last more complicated example:
$ cp -a sourceDirectory target
Here we used the same cp command, but instead we gave it the -a
option which tells cp to copy all the files and keep timestamps and
permissions.
Creating directories: "mkdir"
$ mkdir directory
which will create a directory with the given name inside the current
directory.
Renaming/moving files: "mv"
$ mv source target
mv will move the source path to the destination path. Works for both
directories as files.
Removing files: "rm"
Note: there are NO backups, there is no 'trash bin'. If you
remove files/directories, they are gone.
$ rm filename
rm will remove a file or directory. (rm -rf directory will remove
every file inside a given directory). WARNING: files removed will be
lost forever, there are no backups, so beware when using this command!
Removing a directory: "rmdir"
You can remove directories using rm -r directory, however, this is
error-prone and can ruin your day if you make a mistake in typing. To
prevent this type of error, you can remove the contents of a directory
using rm and then finally removing the directory with:
$ rmdir directory
Changing permissions: "chmod"
[//]: # (#sec:chmod)
