Every file, directory, and link has a set of permissions. These
permissions consist of permission groups and permission types. The
permission groups are:
1.  User - a particular user (account)
2.  Group - a particular group of users (may be user-specific group with
    only one member)
3.  Other - other users in the system
The permission types are:
1.  Read - For files, this gives permission to read the contents of a
    file
2.  Write - For files, this gives permission to write data to the file.
    For directories, it allows users to add or remove files to a
    directory.
3.  Execute - For files this gives permission to execute a file as
    through it were a script. For directories, it allows users to open
    the directory and look at the contents.
Any time you run ls -l you'll see a familiar line of -rwx------ or
similar combination of the letters r, w, x and - (dashes). These
are the permissions for the file or directory. (See also the 
previous section on permissions)
$ ls -l
total 1
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 mygroup 4283648 Apr 12 15:13 articleTable.csv
drwxr-x---. 2 vsc40000 mygroup 40 Apr 12 15:00 Project_GoldenDragon
Here, we see that articleTable.csv is a file (beginning the line with
-) has read and write permission for the user vsc40000 (rw-), and read
permission for the group mygroup as well as all other users (r-- and
r--).
The next entry is Project_GoldenDragon. We see it is a directory
because the line begins with a d. It also has read, write, and execute
permission for the vsc40000 user (rwx). So that user can look into the
directory and add or remove files. Users in the mygroup can also look
into the directory and read the files. But they can't add or remove
files (r-x). Finally, other users can read files in the directory, but
other users have no permissions to look in the directory at all (---).
Maybe we have a colleague who wants to be able to add files to the
directory. We use chmod to change the modifiers to the directory to
let people in the group write to the directory:
$ chmod g+w Project_GoldenDragon
$ ls -l
total 1
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 mygroup 4283648 Apr 12 15:13 articleTable.csv
drwxrwx---. 2 vsc40000 mygroup 40 Apr 12 15:00 Project_GoldenDragon
