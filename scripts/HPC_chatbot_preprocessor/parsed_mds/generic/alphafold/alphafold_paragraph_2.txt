To use AlphaFold, you should load a particular module, for example:
module load AlphaFold/2.3.1-foss-2022a-CUDA-11.7.0
 Tip "We strongly advise loading a specific version of an AlphaFold module, so you know exactly which version is being used."
 Warning
    
    When using AlphaFold, you should submit jobs to a GPU cluster for better performance, see GPU clusters.
    Later in this chapter, you will find a comparison between running AlphaFold on CPUs or GPUs.
Multiple revisions of the large database (~2.5TB) that is also required to run AlphaFold have been
made available on the HPC-UGent infrastructure in a central location (/arcanine/scratch/gent/apps/AlphaFold), 
so you do not have to download it yourself.
$ ls /arcanine/scratch/gent/apps/AlphaFold
20210812  20211201  20220701  20230310
The directories located there indicate when the data was downloaded, so that this leaves room for providing updated datasets later.
As of writing this documentation the latest version is 20230310.
 Info
    
    The arcanine scratch shared filesystem is powered by fast SSD disks, 
    which is recommended for the AlphaFold data, because of random access I/O patterns.
    See Pre-defined user directories to get more info about the arcanine filesystem.
The AlphaFold installations we provide have been modified a bit to facilitate the usage on HPC-UGent infrastructure.
Setting up the environment
The location to the AlphaFold data can be specified via the $ALPHAFOLD_DATA_DIR environment variable, so you should define this variable in your AlphaFold job script:
export ALPHAFOLD_DATA_DIR=/arcanine/scratch/gent/apps/AlphaFold/20230310
 Warning "Use newest version"
    
    Do not forget to replace 20230310 with a more up to date version if available.
Running AlphaFold
AlphaFold provides a script called run_alphafold.py
A symbolic link named alphafold that points to this script is included,
so you can just use alphafold instead of run_alphafold.py or python run_alphafold.py after loading the AlphaFold module.
The run_alphafold.py script has also been slightly modified such that defining the $ALPHAFOLD_DATA_DIR (see above) is sufficient to pick up all the data provided in that location,
so you don't need to use options like --data_dir to specify the location of the data.
