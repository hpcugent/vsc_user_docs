What is AlphaFold?
AlphaFold is an AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts a proteinâ€™s 3D structure from its amino acid sequence. 
It aims to achieve accuracy competitive with experimental methods.
See https://www.vscentrum.be/alphafold for more information and there you can also find a getting started video recording if you prefer that. 
Documentation & extra material
This chapter focuses specifically on the use of AlphaFold on the HPC-UGent infrastructure.
It is intented to augment the existing AlphaFold documentation rather than replace it.
It is therefore recommended to first familiarize yourself with AlphaFold. The following resources can be helpful:
- AlphaFold website: https://alphafold.com/
- AlphaFold repository: https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/tree/main
- AlphaFold FAQ: https://alphafold.com/faq
- VSC webpage about AlphaFold: https://www.vscentrum.be/alphafold
- Introductory course on AlphaFold by VIB: https://elearning.vib.be/courses/alphafold
- "Getting Started with AlphaFold" presentation by Kenneth Hoste (HPC-UGent)
    - recording available on YouTube
    - slides available here (PDF)

Using AlphaFold on HPC-UGent infrastructure
Several different versions of AlphaFold are installed on both the CPU and GPU HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters, see the output of module avail AlphaFold.
If you run this command on a GPU cluster, additional CUDA modules will show up:
$ module avail AlphaFold
