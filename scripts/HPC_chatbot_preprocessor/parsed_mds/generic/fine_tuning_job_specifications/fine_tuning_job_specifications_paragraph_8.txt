It is important to be aware of the sizes of the file that will be
generated, as the available disk space for each user is limited. We
refer to section 
How much disk space do I get? on Quotas to check your
quota and tools to find which files consumed the "quota".
Several actions can be taken, to avoid storage problems:
1.  Be aware of all the files that are generated by your program. Also
    check out the hidden files.
2.  Check your quota consumption regularly.
3.  Clean up your files regularly.
4.  First work (i.e., read and write) with your big files in the local
    /tmp directory. Once finished, you can move your files once to the
    VSC_DATA directories.
5.  Make sure your programs clean up their temporary files after
    execution.
6.  Move your output results to your own computer regularly.
7.  Anyone can request more disk space to the HPC staff, but you will have
    to duly justify your request.
Specifying network requirements
Users can examine their network activities with the htop command. When
your processors are 100% busy, but you see a lot of red bars and only
limited green bars in the htop screen, it is mostly an indication that
they lose a lot of time with inter-process communication.
Whenever your application utilises a lot of inter-process communication
(as is the case in most parallel programs), we strongly recommend to
request nodes with an "InfiniBand" network. The InfiniBand is a
specialised high bandwidth, low latency network that enables large
parallel jobs to run as efficiently as possible.
The parameter to add in your job script would be:
#PBS -l ib
If for some other reasons, a user is fine with the gigabit Ethernet
network, he can specify:
#PBS -l gbe
