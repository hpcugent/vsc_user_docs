Mympirun
mympirun is a tool to make it easier for users of HPC clusters to run
MPI programs with good performance. We strongly recommend to use
mympirun instead of impirun.
In this chapter, we give a high-level overview. For a more detailed
description of all options, see the [vsc-mympirun
README](https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-mympirun/blob/master/README.md).
Basic usage
Before using mympirun, we first need to load its module:
module load vsc-mympirun
As an exception, we don't specify a version here. The reason is that we
want to ensure that the latest version of the mympirun script is
always used, since it may include important bug fixes or improvements.
The most basic form of using mympirun is
mympirun [mympirun options] your_program [your_program options].
For example, to run a program named example and give it a single
argument (5), we can run it with mympirun example 5.
Controlling number of processes
There are four options you can choose from to control the number of
processes mympirun will start. In the following example, the program
mpi_hello prints a single line:
Hello world from processor <node> ... (the sourcecode of mpi_hello
is [available in the vsc-mympirun
repository](https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-mympirun/blob/master/testscripts/mpi_helloworld.c)).
By default, mympirun starts one process per core on every node you
assigned. So if you assigned 2 nodes with 16 cores each, mympirun will
start 2 . 16 = 32 test processes in total.
--hybrid/-h
This is the most commonly used option for controlling the number of
processing.
The --hybrid option requires a positive number. This number specifies
the number of processes started on each available physical node. It
will ignore the number of available cores per node.
$ echo $PBS_NUM_NODES
2
$ mympirun --hybrid 2 ./mpihello
Hello world from processor node3400.doduo.os, rank 1 out of 4 processors 
Hello world from processor node3401.doduo.os, rank 3 out of 4 processors 
Hello world from processor node3401.doduo.os, rank 2 out of 4 processors 
Hello world from processor node3400.doduo.os, rank 0 out of 4 processors
