Other options
There's also --universe, which sets the exact amount of processes
started by mympirun; --double, which uses double the amount of
processes it normally would; and --multi that does the same as
--double, but takes a multiplier (instead of the implied factor 2 with
--double).
See [vsc-mympirun
README](https://github.com/hpcugent/vsc-mympirun/blob/master/README.md)
for a detailed explanation of these options.
Dry run
You can do a so-called "dry run", which doesn't have any side-effects,
but just prints the command that mympirun would execute. You enable
this with the --dry-run flag:
$ mympirun --dry-run ./mpi_hello
mpirun ... -genv I_MPI_FABRICS shm:dapl ... -np 16 ... ./mpi_hello
