Users can connect from any computer in the UGent network to the HPC, regardless
of the Operating System that they are using on their personal computer.
Users can use any of the common Operating Systems (such as Windows,
macOS or any version of Linux/Unix/BSD) and run and control their
programs on the HPC.
A user does not need to have prior knowledge about Linux; all of the
required knowledge is explained in this tutorial.
What does a typical workflow look like?
A typical workflow looks like:
1.  Connect to the login nodes with SSH (see First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure)
2.  Transfer your files to the cluster (see Transfer Files to/from the HPC)
3.  Optional: compile your code and test it (for compiling, see Compiling and testing your software on the HPC)
4.  Create a job script and submit your job (see Running batch jobs)
5.  Get some coffee and be patient:
    1.  Your job gets into the queue
    2.  Your job gets executed
    3.  Your job finishes
6.  Study the results generated by your jobs, either on the cluster or
    after downloading them locally.
What is the next step? 
When you think that the HPC is a useful tool to support your computational
needs, we encourage you to acquire a VSC-account (as explained in Getting a HPC Account),
read Connecting to the HPC infrastructure, "Setting up the environment", and explore
chapters Running interactive jobs to Fine-tuning Job Specifications which will help you to transfer and run your programs on the HPC cluster.
Do not hesitate to contact the HPC staff for any help.
