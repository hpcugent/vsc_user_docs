How do SSH keys work?
-   an SSH public/private key pair can be seen as a lock and a key
-   the SSH public key is equivalent with a lock: you give it to the
    VSC and they put it on the door that gives access to your account.
-   the SSH private key is like a physical key: you don't hand it out
    to other people.
-   anyone who has the key (and the optional password) can unlock the
    door and log in to the account.
-   the door to your VSC account is special: it can have multiple
    locks (SSH public keys) attached to it, and you only need to open
    one lock with the corresponding key (SSH private key) to open
    the door (log in to the account).
Since all VSC clusters use Linux as their main operating system, you
will need to get acquainted with using the command-line interface and
using the terminal (see tutorial).
