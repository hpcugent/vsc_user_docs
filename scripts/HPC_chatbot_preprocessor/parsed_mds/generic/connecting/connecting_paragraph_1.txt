Connecting to the HPC infrastructure
Before you can really start using the HPC clusters, there are several things
you need to do or know:
1.  You need to log on to the cluster using an SSH client to one of
    the login nodes or by using the HPC web portal.
    This will give you command-line access.
    A standard web browser like Firefox or Chrome for the web portal will suffice.
2.  Before you can do some work, you'll have to transfer the files
    that you need from your desktop computer to the cluster. At the end
    of a job, you might want to transfer some files back.
3.  Optionally, if you wish to use programs with a **graphical user
    interface**, you will need an X-server on your client system and log
    in to the login nodes with X-forwarding enabled.
