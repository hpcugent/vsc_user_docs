Congratulations, you're on the HPC infrastructure now!
To find out where you have landed you can print the current working directory:
$ pwd
/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000

Your new private home directory is "/user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000". Here you can create your own

$ cd /apps/gent/tutorials
$ ls
