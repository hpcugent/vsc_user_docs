If you want to find out which login host you are connected to, you can use the hostname command.
$ hostname
gligar07.gastly.os
$ ssh gligar08.gastly.os
$ hostname
gligar08.gastly.os

Rather than always starting a new session on the HPC, you can also use a terminal multiplexer like screen or tmux.
These can make sessions that 'survives' across disconnects.
You can find more information on how to use these tools here (or on other online sources):
- screen
