Connection restrictions
Since March 20th 2020, restrictions are in place that limit from where
you can connect to the VSC HPC infrastructure, in response to security
incidents involving several European HPC centres.
VSC login nodes are only directly accessible from within university
networks, and from (most) Belgian commercial internet providers.
All other IP domains are blocked by default. If you are connecting from
an IP address that is not allowed direct access, you have the following
options to get access to VSC login nodes:
-   Use an VPN connection to connect to UGent the network (recommended). See <https://helpdesk.ugent.be/vpn/en/> for more information. 
-   Whitelist your IP address automatically by accessing
    <https://firewall.vscentrum.be> and log in with your UGent account.
    -   While this web connection is active new SSH sessions can be
        started.
    -   Active SSH sessions will remain active even when this web page
        is closed.
-   Contact your HPC support team (via hpc@ugent.be) and ask them to whitelist your
    IP range (e.g., for industry access, automated processes).
