    You may encounter a warning message similar to the following one during connecting:
    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    LANGUAGE = (unset),
    LC_ALL = (unset),
    LC_CTYPE = "UTF-8",
    LANG = (unset)
        are supported and installed on your system.
    perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
    or any other error message complaining about the locale.
    This means that the correct "locale" has not yet been properly specified on your local machine. Try:
    LANG=
    LC_COLLATE="C"
    LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"
    LC_MESSAGES="C"
    LC_MONETARY="C"
    LC_NUMERIC="C"
    LC_TIME="C"
