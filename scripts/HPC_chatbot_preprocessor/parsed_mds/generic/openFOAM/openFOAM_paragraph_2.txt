Preparing the environment
To prepare the environment of your shell session or job for using
OpenFOAM, there are a couple of things to take into account.
Picking and loading an OpenFOAM module
First of all, you need to pick and load one of the available OpenFOAM
modules. To get an overview of the available modules, run
'module avail OpenFOAM'. For example:
$ module avail OpenFOAM
------------------ /apps/gent/CO7/sandybridge/modules/all ------------------
   OpenFOAM/v1712-foss-2017b     OpenFOAM/4.1-intel-2017a
   OpenFOAM/v1712-intel-2017b    OpenFOAM/5.0-intel-2017a
   OpenFOAM/2.2.2-intel-2017a    OpenFOAM/5.0-intel-2017b
   OpenFOAM/2.2.2-intel-2018a    OpenFOAM/5.0-20180108-foss-2018a
   OpenFOAM/2.3.1-intel-2017a    OpenFOAM/5.0-20180108-intel-2017b
   OpenFOAM/2.4.0-intel-2017a    OpenFOAM/5.0-20180108-intel-2018a
   OpenFOAM/3.0.1-intel-2016b    OpenFOAM/6-intel-2018a            (D)
   OpenFOAM/4.0-intel-2016b
To pick a module, take into account the differences between the
different OpenFOAM versions w.r.t. features and API (see also Different OpenFOAM releases). If
multiple modules are available that fulfill your requirements, give
preference to those providing a more recent OpenFOAM version, and to the
ones that were installed with a more recent compiler toolchain; for
example, prefer a module that includes intel-b in its name over one
that includes intel-a.
To prepare your environment for using OpenFOAM, load the OpenFOAM
module you have picked; for example:
module load OpenFOAM/11-foss-2023a
Sourcing the $FOAM_BASH script
OpenFOAM provides a script that you should source to further prepare
the environment. This script will define some additional environment
variables that are required to use OpenFOAM. The OpenFOAM modules
define an environment variable named FOAM_BASH that specifies the
location to this script. Assuming you are using bash in your shell
session or job script, you should always run the following command after
loading an OpenFOAM module:
