OpenFOAM
In this chapter, we outline best practices for using the centrally
provided OpenFOAM installations on the VSC HPC infrastructure.
Different OpenFOAM releases
There are currently three different sets of versions of OpenFOAM
available, each with its own versioning scheme:
-   OpenFOAM versions released via http://openfoam.com: v3.0+,
    v1706
    -   see also http://openfoam.com/history/
-   OpenFOAM versions released via https://openfoam.org: v4.1,
    v5.0
    -   see also https://openfoam.org/download/history/
-   OpenFOAM versions released via
    http://wikki.gridcore.se/foam-extend: v3.1
Make sure you know which flavor of OpenFOAM you want to use, since there
are important differences between the different versions w.r.t.
features. If the OpenFOAM version you need is not available yet, see I want to use software that is not available on the clusters yet.
Documentation & training material
The best practices outlined here focus specifically on the use of
OpenFOAM on the VSC HPC infrastructure. As such, they are intended to
augment the existing OpenFOAM documentation rather than replace it. For
more general information on using OpenFOAM, please refer to:
