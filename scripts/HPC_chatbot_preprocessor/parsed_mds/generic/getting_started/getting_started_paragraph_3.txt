To understand what's going on here, see the section on cd below.
The moral here is: **be very careful to not use empty variables
unintentionally**.
**Tip for job scripts: use set -e -u to avoid using empty variables
accidentally.**
The -e option will result in the script getting stopped if
any command fails.
The -u option will result in the script getting stopped if
empty variables are used. (see https://ss64.com/bash/set.html for
a more detailed explanation and more options)

Restoring your default environment
If you've made a mess of your environment, you shouldn't waste too
much time trying to fix it. Just log out and log in again and you will
be given a pristine environment.
Basic system information
Basic information about the system you are logged into can be obtained
in a variety of ways.
We limit ourselves to determining the hostname: 
$ hostname 
gligar01.gligar.os
$ echo $HOSTNAME 
gligar01.gligar.os 
And querying some basic information about the Linux kernel:
$ uname -a 
Linux gligar01.gligar.os 2.6.32-573.8.1.el6.ug.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Nov 16 15:12:09
	CET 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
