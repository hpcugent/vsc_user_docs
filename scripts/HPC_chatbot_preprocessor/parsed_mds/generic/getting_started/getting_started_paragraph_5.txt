Hurray ðŸŽ‰, we trained a deep learning model and achieved 97,64 percent accuracy.
 Warning
    When using TensorFlow specifically, you should actually submit jobs to a GPU cluster for better performance, see GPU clusters.
    For the purpose of this example, we are running a very small TensorFlow workload on a CPU-only cluster.
Next steps
- Running interactive jobs
- Running jobs with input/output data
- Multi core jobs/Parallel Computing
- Interactive and debug cluster
