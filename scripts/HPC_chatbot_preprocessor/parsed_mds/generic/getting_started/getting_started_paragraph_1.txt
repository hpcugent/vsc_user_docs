Getting Started
Logging in
To get started with the HPC-UGent infrastructure, you need to obtain a
VSC account, see HPC manual. **Keep in mind that you
must keep your private key to yourself!**
You can look at your public/private key pair as a lock and a key: you
give us the lock (your public key), we put it on the door, and then you
can use your key to open the door and get access to the HPC
infrastructure. Anyone who has your key can use your VSC account!
Details on connecting to the HPC infrastructure are available in [HPC
manual connecting section](../connecting.md).
Getting help
To get help:
1.  use the documentation available on the system, through the
    help, info and man commands (use q to exit).
    help cd 
    info ls 
    man cp 
2.  use Google
3. contact hpc@ugent.be in case
of problems or questions (even for basic things!)
Errors
Sometimes when executing a command, an error occurs. Most likely there
will be error output or a message explaining you this. Read this
carefully and try to act on it. Try googling the error first to find any
possible solution, but if you can't come up with something in 15
minutes, don't hesitate to mail 
hpc@ugent.be
Basic terminal usage
The basic interface is the so-called shell prompt, typically ending with
$ (for bash shells).
You use the shell by executing commands, and hitting
<enter>. For example: 
$ echo hello 
hello 
You can go to the start or end of the command line using
Ctrl-A or Ctrl-E.
To go through previous commands, use <up> and
<down>, rather than retyping them.
Command history
A powerful feature is that you can "search" through your command
history, either using the history command, or using
Ctrl-R: 
$ history
    1 echo hello
# hit Ctrl-R, type 'echo' 
(reverse-i-search)`echo': echo hello
Stopping commands
If for any reason you want to stop a command from executing, press
Ctrl-C. For example, if a command is taking too long, or
you want to rerun it with different arguments.
