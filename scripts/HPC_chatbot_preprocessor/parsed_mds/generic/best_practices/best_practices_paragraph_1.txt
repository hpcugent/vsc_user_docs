1.  Before starting, you should always check:
    -   Are there any errors in the script?
    -   Are the required modules loaded?
    -   Is the correct executable used?
2.  Check your computer requirements upfront, and request the correct
    resources in your batch job script.
    -   Number of requested cores
    -   Amount of requested memory
    -   Requested network type
3.  Check your jobs at runtime. You could login to the node and check
    the proper execution of your jobs with, e.g., top or vmstat.
    Alternatively you could run an interactive job (qsub -I).
4.  Try to benchmark the software for scaling issues when using MPI or
    for I/O issues.
5.  Use the scratch file system ($VSC_SCRATCH_NODE, which is mapped to
    the local /tmp) whenever possible. Local disk I/O is always much
    faster as it does not have to use the network.
6.  When your job starts, it will log on to the compute node(s) and
    start executing the commands in the job script. It will start in
    your home directory $VSC_HOME, so going to the current directory
    with cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR is the first thing which needs to be done.
    You will have your default environment, so don't forget to load the
    software with module load.
[//]: # (Do not worry, it will render with correct numbering in all cases.)
7.  In case your job not running, use "checkjob". It will show why your
    job is not yet running. Sometimes commands might timeout with an
    overloaded scheduler.
8.  Submit your job and wait (be patient) ...
9.  Submit small jobs by grouping them together. See chapter Multi-job submission for 
    how this is done.
10. The runtime is limited by the maximum walltime of the queues.
11. Requesting many processors could imply long queue times. It's
    advised to only request the resources you'll be able to use.
12. For all multi-node jobs, please use a cluster that has an
    "InfiniBand" interconnect network.
13. And above all, do not hesitate to contact the HPC staff at hpc@ugent.be. We're here
