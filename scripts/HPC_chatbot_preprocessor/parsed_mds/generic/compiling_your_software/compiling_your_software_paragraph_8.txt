A new file "hello" has been created. Note that this file has "execute"
rights, i.e., it is an executable. More often than not, calling gcc --
or any other compiler for that matter -- will provide you with a list of
errors and warnings referring to mistakes the programmer made, such as
typos, syntax errors. You will have to correct them first in order to
make the code compile. Warnings pinpoint less crucial issues that may
relate to performance problems, using unsafe or obsolete language
features, etc. It is good practice to remove all warnings from a
compilation process, even if they seem unimportant so that a code change
that produces a warning does not go unnoticed.
Let's test this program on the local compute node, which is at your
disposal after the qsub --I command:
$ ./hello
Hello #0
Hello #1
Hello #2
Hello #3
Hello #4
...
