Software, which is not portable in this sense, will have to be
transferred with modifications to support the environment on the
destination machine.
Whilst programming, it would be wise to stick to certain standards
(e.g., ISO/ANSI/POSIX). This will ease the porting of your code to other
platforms.
Porting your code to the RHEL 8.8 (accelgor, doduo, donphan, gallade, joltik, skitty) platform is the responsibility of the end-user.
Compiling and building on the HPC
Compiling refers to the process of translating code written in some
programming language, e.g., Fortran, C, or C++, to machine code.
Building is similar, but includes gluing together the machine code
resulting from different source files into an executable (or library).
The text below guides you through some basic problems typical for small
software projects. For larger projects it is more appropriate to use
makefiles or even an advanced build system like CMake.
