Check the pre-installed software on the HPC
In order to check all the available modules and their version numbers,
which are pre-installed on the HPC enter:
When your required application is not available on the HPC please contact
any HPC member. Be aware of potential "License Costs". "Open Source"
software is often preferred.
Porting your code
To port a software-program is to translate it from the operating system in
which it was developed (e.g., Windows 7) to another operating system
(e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux on our HPC) so that it can be used there. Porting implies some
degree of effort, but not nearly as much as redeveloping the program in
the new environment. It all depends on how "portable" you wrote your
code.
