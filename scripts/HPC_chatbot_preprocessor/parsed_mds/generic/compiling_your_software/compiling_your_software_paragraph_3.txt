In the simplest case the file or files may simply be copied from one
machine to the other. However, in many cases the software is installed
on a computer in a way, which depends upon its detailed hardware,
software, and setup, with device drivers for particular devices, using
installed operating system and supporting software components, and using
different directories.
In some cases software, usually described as "portable software" is
specifically designed to run on different computers with compatible
operating systems and processors without any machine-dependent
installation; it is sufficient to transfer specified directories and
their contents. Hardware- and software-specific information is often
stored in configuration files in specified locations (e.g., the registry
on machines running MS Windows).
