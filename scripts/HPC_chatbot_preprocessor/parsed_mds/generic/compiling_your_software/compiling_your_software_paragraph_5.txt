We will compile this C/MPI -file into an executable with the Intel
Parallel Studio Cluster Edition. First, clear the modules (purge) and
then load the latest "intel" module:
module purge
module load intel
Then, compile and list the contents of the directory again. The Intel
equivalent of mpicc is mpiicc.
mpiicc -o mpihello mpihello.c
ls -l
Note that the old "mpihello" file has been overwritten. Let's test this
program on the "login" node first:
$ ./mpihello
Hello World from Node 0.
It seems to work, now run it on the HPC.
qsub mpihello.pbs
Note: The AUGent only has a license for the Intel Parallel Studio Cluster
Edition for a fixed number of users. As such, it might happen that you
have to wait a few minutes before a floating license becomes available
for your use.
Note: The Intel Parallel Studio Cluster Edition contains equivalent
compilers for all GNU compilers. Hereafter the overview for C, C++ and
Fortran compilers.
