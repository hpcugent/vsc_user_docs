All the HPC nodes run the same version of the Operating System, i.e. RHEL 8.8 (accelgor, doduo, donphan, gallade, joltik, skitty). So,
it is sufficient to compile your program on any compute node. Once you
have generated an executable with your compiler, this executable should
be able to run on any other compute-node.
A typical process looks like:
1.  Copy your software to the login-node of the HPC
2.  Start an interactive session on a compute node;
3.  Compile it;
4.  Test it locally;
5.  Generate your job scripts;
6.  Test it on the HPC
7.  Run it (in parallel);
We assume you've copied your software to the HPC. The next step is to request
your private compute node.
