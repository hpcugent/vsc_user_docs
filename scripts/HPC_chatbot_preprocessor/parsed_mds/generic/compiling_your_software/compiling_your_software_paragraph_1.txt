Compiling and testing your software on the HPC
All nodes in the HPC cluster are running the "RHEL 8.8 (accelgor, doduo, donphan, gallade, joltik, skitty)" 
Operating system, which is a specific version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This means that all the 
software programs
(executable) that the end-user wants to run on the HPC first must be
compiled for RHEL 8.8 (accelgor, doduo, donphan, gallade, joltik, skitty). It also means that you first have to install all the
required external software packages on the HPC.
Most commonly used compilers are already pre-installed on the HPC and can be
used straight away. Also, many popular external software packages, which
are regularly used in the scientific community, are also pre-installed.
