The "hello.c" program is a simple source file, written in C. It'll print
500 times "Hello #&lt;num&gt;", and waits one second between 2 printouts.
We first need to compile this C-file into an executable with the
gcc-compiler.
First, check the command line options for *"gcc" (GNU C-Compiler)*, then
we compile. the O2 option enables a moderate level of optimization when compiling the code. 
It instructs the compiler to optimize the code for better performance without significantly increasing compilation time.
Finally, list the contents of the directory again:
$ gcc -help
$ gcc -O2 -o hello hello.c
$ ls -l
total 512
-rwxrwxr-x 1 vsc40000 7116 Sep 16 11:43 hello*
-rw-r--r-- 1 vsc40000  214 Sep 16 09:42 hello.c
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vsc40000  130 Sep 16 11:39 hello.pbs*
