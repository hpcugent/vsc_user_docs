Usually, this ends the process, giving it the opportunity to flush data
to files, etc. However, if the process ignored your signal, you can send
it a different message
(SIGKILL)
which the OS will use to unceremoniously terminate the process:
$ kill -9 1234
top
top is a tool to see the current status of the system. You've probably
used something similar in Task Manager on Windows or Activity Monitor in
macOS. top will update every second and has a few interesting
commands.
To see only your processes, type u and your username after starting
top, (you can also do this with 
top -u $USER
). The default is to
sort the display by %CPU. To change the sort order, use < and >
like arrow keys.
There are a lot of configuration options in top, but if you're
interested in seeing a nicer view, you can run htop instead. Be aware
that it's not installed everywhere, while top is.
To exit top, use q (for 'quit').

performance analysis](http://brendangregg.com).
ulimit
ulimit is a utility to get or set user limits on the machine. For
example, you may be limited to a certain number of processes. To see all
the limits that have been set, use:
$ ulimit -a
Counting: wc
To count the number of lines, words, and characters (or bytes) in a file, use wc (word count):
$ wc example.txt
      90     468     3189   example.txt
The output indicates that the file named example.txt contains 90
lines, 468 words, and 3189 characters/bytes.
To only count the number of lines, use wc -l:
$ wc -l example.txt
      90    example.txt
Searching file contents: grep
grep is an important command. It was originally an abbreviation for
"globally search a regular expression and print" but it's entered the
common computing lexicon and people use 'grep' to mean searching for
anything. To use grep, you give a pattern and a list of files.
$ grep banana fruit.txt
$ grep banana fruit_bowl1.txt fruit_bowl2.txt
$ grep banana fruit*txt
grep also lets you search for [Regular
Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), but
these are not in scope for this introductory text.
