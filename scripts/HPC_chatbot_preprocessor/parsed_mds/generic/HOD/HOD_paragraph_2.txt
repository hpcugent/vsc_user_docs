By defining these environment variables, we avoid that you have to
specify --hod-module and --workdir when using hod batch or
hod create, since they are strictly required.
If you want to use a different parent working directory for HOD, it
suffices to either redefine $HOD_BATCH_WORKDIR and
$HOD_CREATE_WORKDIR, or to specify --workdir (which will override
the corresponding environment variable).
Changing the HOD module that is used by the HOD backend (i.e., using
--hod-module or redefining $HOD_*_HOD_MODULE) is strongly
discouraged.
Cleaning up
After HOD clusters terminate, their local working directory and cluster
information is typically not cleaned up automatically (for example,
because the job hosting an interactive HOD cluster submitted via
hod create runs out of walltime).
These HOD clusters will still show up in the output of hod list, and
will be marked as <job-not-found>.
You should occasionally clean this up using hod clean:
$ module list
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) cluster/doduo(default)   2) pbs_python/4.6.0            3) vsc-base/2.4.2              4) hod/3.0.0-cli
$ hod list
Cluster label	Job ID		   State                Hosts
example1        123456         &lt;job-not-found&gt;     &lt;none&gt;
$ hod clean
Removed cluster localworkdir directory /user/scratch/gent/vsc400/vsc40000/hod/hod/123456 for cluster labeled example1
Removed cluster info directory /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000/.config/hod.d/wordcount for cluster labeled example1
$ module swap cluster/donphan
Cluster label	Job ID				            State              	Hosts
example2		98765.master19.donphan.gent.vsc	&lt;job-not-found&gt;     &lt;none&gt;
$ hod clean
Removed cluster localworkdir directory /user/scratch/gent/vsc400/vsc40000/hod/hod/98765.master19.donphan.gent.vsc for cluster labeled example2
Removed cluster info directory /user/home/gent/vsc400/vsc40000/.config/hod.d/wordcount for cluster labeled example2
Note that only HOD clusters that were submitted to the currently loaded cluster module will be cleaned up.
