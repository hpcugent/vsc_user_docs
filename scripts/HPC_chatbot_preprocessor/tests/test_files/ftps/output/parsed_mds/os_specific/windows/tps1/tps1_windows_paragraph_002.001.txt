OS specific sections
This is the second section, it is the start of some  text specific to windows.
In this section it is probably no longer needed to test the Markdown syntax again, however I will make it somewhat longer 
to make sure we get a long section that is over the minimum required length for the next newline character to be 
classified as the end of this section. I am doing this because for the next sections I want to test whether they will be
grouped together if they are not long enough to reach the minimum paragraph length on their own. Also, before I forget, 
let's add a link in this section as well.
