# Title

Some explanation about the following list that is quite long. This could be problematic since this could mean that the explanation of the content of the list would be part of a different paragraph than the list.

1. First entry that is very verbose since we want to hit the character limit for a paragraph to make sure a list can't be split in the middle. If this entry is long enough, the character limit should make it so that any of the following newlines can be the start of a new section if the splitter doesn't know it is in a list.

2. Second entry

3. Third entry

4. Fourth entry that is very verbose, so we hit the character limit for a section split, even though it shouldn't be necessary since the explanation of the list is already well above the character limit.

And now the text continues like normal in a new section.
