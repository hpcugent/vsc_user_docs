# Graphical applications with X2Go

X2Go is a graphical desktop software for Linux similar to VNC but with
extra advantages. It does not require to execute a server in the login
node and it is possible to setup a SSH proxy to connect to an specific
login node. It can also be used to access Windows, Linux and macOS
desktops. X2Go provides several advantages such:

1.  A graphical remote desktop that works well over low bandwidth
    connections.

2.  Copy/paste support from client to server and vice-versa.

3.  File sharing from client to server.

4.  Support for sound.

5.  Printer sharing from client to server.

6.  The ability to access single applications by specifying the name of
    the desired executable like a terminal or an internet browser.

## Install X2Go client 

X2Go is available for several operating systems. You can download the
latest client from
<https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient>.

X2Go requires a valid private SSH key to connect to the login node, this
is described in [How do SSH keys work?](../account/#how-do-ssh-keys-work). This section also describes how to use X2Go client
with a SSH agent. The SSH agent setup is optional but it is the easiest
way to connect to the login nodes using several SSH keys and
applications. Please see [Using an SSH agent (optional)](../account/#using-an-ssh-agent-optional) if you want to know how to setup an SSH agent
in your system.

## Create a new X2Go session

After the X2Go client installation just start the client. When you
launch the client for the first time, it will start the new session
dialogue automatically.

There are two ways to connect to the login node:

-   *Option A*: A direct connection to "***{{loginnode}}***". This is the simpler option,
    the system will decide which login node to use based on a
    load-balancing algorithm.

-   *Option B*: You can use the node "***{{loginnode}}***" as SSH proxy to connect to a
    specific login node. Use this option if you want to resume an old
    X2Go session.

### Option A: direct connection

This is the easier way to setup X2Go, a direct connection to the login
node.

1.  Include a session name. This will help you to identify the session
    if you have more than one, you can choose any name (in our example
    "HPC login node").

2.  Set the login hostname (In our case: "***{{loginnode}}***")

3.  Set the Login name. In the example is "**{{userid}}**" but you must change it by
    your current VSC account.

4.  Set the SSH port (22 by default).

5.  Skip this step if you are using an SSH agent (see [Install X2Go](./#install-x2go-client)). If not add your
    SSH private key into "Use RSA/DSA key.." field. In this case:

    1.  Click on the "Use RSA/DSA.." folder icon. This will open a file
        browser.

        ![image](img/ch19-x2go-ssh-key.png)
{% if OS == (macos or linux) %}
    2.  You should look for your **private** SSH key generated in [Generating a public/private key pair](../account/#generating-a-publicprivate-key-pair). This file has
        been stored in the directory "*~/.ssh/*" (by default "**id_rsa**"). 
{%- endif %}
{%- if OS == macos %}
        ".ssh" is an invisible directory, the Finder will not show it by
        default. The easiest way to access the folder, is by pressing ++"cmd"+"shift"+"g"++ , which will allow you to enter the name of a directory, which
        you would like to open in Finder. Here, type "/.ssh" and press
        enter. Choose that file and click on ++"open"++ . 
{% endif %}
{% if OS == windows%}        
        You should look for your **private** SSH key generated by ++"puttygen"++ exported in "*OpenSSH*" format in [Generating a public/private key pair](../account/#generating-a-publicprivate-key-pair) (by
        default "**id_rsa**" (and **not** the ".ppk" version)). Choose that file and click
        on ++"open"++ .
{% endif %}

1.  Check "Try autologin" option.

2.  Choose Session type to ++"XFCE"++. Only the ++"XFCE"++ desktop is available for the
    moment. It is also possible to choose single applications instead of
    a full desktop, like the ++"Terminal"++ or ++"Internet browser"++ (you can change this option later
    directly from the X2Go session tab if you want).

    1.  **[optional]:** Set a single application like ++"Terminal"++ instead of ++"XFCE"++ desktop. 
{%- if OS == windows %}   
        This option is
        much better than PuTTY because the X2Go client includes
        copy-pasting support.
{% endif %}

        ![image](img/ch19-x2go-configuration-xterm.png)

1.  **[optional]:** Change the session icon.

2.  Click the ++"OK"++ button after these changes.

### Option B: use the login node as SSH proxy 

This option is useful if you want to resume a previous session or if you
want to set explicitly the login node to use. In this case you should
include a few more options. Use the same **Option A** setup but with these changes:

![image](img/ch19-x2go-configuration-gent-proxy.png)

1.  Include a session name. This will help you to identify the session
    if you have more than one (in our example "HPC UGent proxy login").

2.  Set the login hostname. This is the login node that you want to use
    at the end (In our case: "***{{loginhost}}***")

3.  Set "Use Proxy server.." to enable the proxy. Within "Proxy section"
    set also these options:

    1.  Set Type "SSH", "Same login", "Same Password" and "SSH agent"
        options.

    2.  Set Host to "***{{loginnode}}***" within "Proxy Server" section as well.

    3.  Skip this step if you are using an SSH agent (see [Install X2Go](./#install-x2go-client)). Add your **private**
        SSH key within "RSA/DSA key" field within "Proxy Server" as you
        did for the server configuration (The "RSA/DSA key" field must
        be set in both sections)

        ![image](img/ch19-x2go-proxy-key.png)

    4.  Click the ++"OK"++ button after these changes.

## Connect to your X2Go session 

Just click on any session that you already have to start/resume any
session. It will take a few seconds to open the session the first time.
It is possible to terminate a session if you logout from the current
open session or if you click on the "shutdown" button from X2Go. If you
want to suspend your session to continue working with it later just
click on the "pause" icon.

![image](img/ch19-x2go-pause.png)

X2Go will keep the session open for you (but only if the login node is
not rebooted).

## Resume a previous session 

If you want to re-connect to the same login node, or resume a previous
session, you should know which login node were used at first place. You
can get this information before logging out from your X2Go session. Just
open a terminal and execute:

```
hostname
```

![image](img/ch19-x2go-xterm.png)

This will give you the full login name (like "***{{loginhost}}***" but the hostname in your
situation may be slightly different). You should set the same name to
resume the session the next time. Just add this full hostname into
"login hostname" section in your X2Go session (see [Option B: use the login node as SSH proxy](./#option-b-use-the-login-node-as-ssh-proxy)).

## Connection failed with X2Go

If you get the error "**Connection failed** session vscXXYYY-123-4567890123_xyzXFCE_dp32
terminated" (or similar), It is possible that an old X2Go session
remained on the login node. First, choose a different session type (for
example TERMINAL), then start the X2Go session. A window will pop up,
and you should see that a session is running. Select the session and
terminate it. Then finish the session, choose again XFCE session (or
whatever you use), then you should have your X2Go session. Since we have
multiple login nodes, you might have to repeat these steps multiple
times.
