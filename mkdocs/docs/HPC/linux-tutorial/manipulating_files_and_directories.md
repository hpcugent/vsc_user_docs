# Manipulating files and directories

Being able to manage your data is an important part of using the HPC
infrastructure. The bread and butter commands for doing this are
mentioned here. It might seem annoyingly terse at first, but with
practice you will realise that it's very practical to have such common
commands short to type.

## File contents: "cat", "head", "tail", "less", "more"

To print the contents of an entire file, you can use `cat`; to only see
the first or last N lines, you can use `head` or `tail`:
<pre><code>$ <b>cat one.txt</b>
1
2
3
4
5

$ <b>head -2 one.txt</b>
1
2

$ <b>tail -2 one.txt</b>
4
5
</code></pre>

To check the contents of long text files, you can use the `less` or
`more` commands which support scrolling with "&lt;up&gt;", "&lt;down&gt;",
"&lt;space&gt;", etc.

## Copying files: "cp"

<pre><code>$ <b>cp source target</b>
</code></pre>

This is the `cp` command, which copies a file from source to target. To
copy a directory, we use the `-r` option:
<pre><code>$ <b>cp -r sourceDirectory target</b>
</code></pre>

A last more complicated example:
<pre><code>$ <b>cp -a sourceDirectory target</b>
</code></pre>

Here we used the same `cp` command, but instead we gave it the `-a`
option which tells cp to copy all the files and keep timestamps and
permissions.

## Creating directories: "mkdir"

<pre><code>$ <b>mkdir directory</b>
</code></pre>

which will create a directory with the given name inside the current
directory.

## Renaming/moving files: "mv"

<pre><code>$ <b>mv source target</b>
</code></pre>

`mv` will move the source path to the destination path. Works for both
directories as files.

## Removing files: "rm"

<b>Note: there are NO backups, there is no 'trash bin'. If you
remove files/directories, they are gone.</b>
<pre><code>$ <b>rm filename</b>
</code></pre>
`rm` will remove a file or directory. (`rm -rf directory` will remove
every file inside a given directory). WARNING: files removed will be
lost forever, there are no backups, so beware when using this command!

#### Removing a directory: "rmdir"

You can remove directories using `rm -r directory`, however, this is
error prone and can ruin your day if you make a mistake in typing. To
prevent this type of error, you can remove the contents of a directory
using `rm` and then finally removing the directory with:
<pre><code>$ <b>rmdir directory</b>
</code></pre>
## Changing permissions: "chmod"

[//]: # (#sec:chmod)

Every file, directory, and link has a set of permissions. These
permissions consist of permission groups and permission types. The
permission groups are:

1.  User - a particular user (account)

2.  Group - a particular group of users (may be user-specific group with
    only one member)

3.  Other - other users in the system

The permission types are:

1.  Read - For files, this gives permission to read the contents of a
    file

2.  Write - For files, this gives permission to write data to the file.
    For directories it allows users to add or remove files to a
    directory.

3.  Execute - For files this gives permission to execute a file as
    through it were a script. For directories, it allows users to open
    the directory and look at the contents.

Any time you run `ls -l` you'll see a familiar line of `-rwx------` or
similar combination of the letters `r`, `w`, `x` and `-` (dashes). These
are the permissions for the file or directory. (See also the 
[previous section on permissions](navigating.md#permissions))
<pre><code>$ <b>ls -l</b>
total 1
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 mygroup 4283648 Apr 12 15:13 articleTable.csv
drwxr-x---. 2 vsc40000 mygroup 40 Apr 12 15:00 Project_GoldenDragon
</code></pre>

Here, we see that `articleTable.csv` is a file (beginning the line with
`-`) has read and write permission for the user `vsc40000` (`rw-`), and read
permission for the group `mygroup` as well as all other users (`r--` and
`r--`).

The next entry is `Project_GoldenDragon`. We see it is a directory
because the line begins with a `d`. It also has read, write, and execute
permission for the `vsc40000` user (`rwx`). So that user can look into the
directory and add or remove files. Users in the `mygroup` can also look
into the directory and read the files. But they can't add or remove
files (`r-x`). Finally, other users can read files in the directory, but
other users have no permissions to look in the directory at all (`---`).

Maybe we have a colleague who wants to be able to add files to the
directory. We use `chmod` to change the modifiers to the directory to
let people in the group write to the directory:
<pre><code>$ <b>chmod g+w Project_GoldenDragon</b>
$ <b>ls -l</b>
total 1
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 mygroup 4283648 Apr 12 15:13 articleTable.csv
drwxrwx---. 2 vsc40000 mygroup 40 Apr 12 15:00 Project_GoldenDragon
</code></pre>

The syntax used here is `g+x` which means roup was given rite
permission. To revoke it again, we use `g-w`. The other roles are `u`
for user and `o` for other.

You can put multiple changes on the same line:
`chmod o-rwx,g-rxw,u+rx,u-w somefile` will take everyone's permission
away except the user's ability to read or execute the file.

You can also use the `-R` flag to affect all the files within a
directory, but this is dangerous. It's best to refine your search using
`find` and then pass the resulting list to `chmod` since it's not usual
for all files in a directory structure to have the same permissions.

### Access control lists (ACLs)

However, this means that all users in `mygroup` can add or remove files.
This could be problematic if you only wanted one person to be allowed to
help you administer the files in the project. We need a new group. To do
this in the HPC environment, we need to use access control lists (ACLs):
<pre><code>$ <b>setfacl -m u:otheruser:w Project_GoldenDragon</b>
$ <b>ls -l Project_GoldenDragon</b>
drwxr-x---+ 2 vsc40000 mygroup 40 Apr 12 15:00 Project_GoldenDragon
</code></pre>

This will give the **u**ser `otheruser` permissions to **w**rite to
`Project_GoldenDragon`

Now there is a `+` at the end of the line. This means there is an ACL
attached to the directory. `getfacl Project_GoldenDragon` will print the
ACLs for the directory.

Note: most people don't use ACLs, but it's sometimes the right thing and
you should be aware it exists.

See <https://linux.die.net/man/1/setfacl> for more information.

## Zipping: "gzip"/"gunzip", "zip"/"unzip"

Files should usually be stored in a compressed file if they're not being
used frequently. This means they will use less space and thus you get
more out of your quota. Some types of files (e.g., CSV files with a lot
of numbers) compress as much as 9:1. The most commonly used compression
format on Linux is gzip. To compress a file using gzip, we use:
<pre><code>$ <b>ls -lh myfile</b>
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 4.1M Dec 2 11:14 myfile
$ <b>gzip myfile</b>
$ <b>ls -lh myfile.gz</b>
-rw-r--r--. 1 vsc40000 vsc40000 1.1M Dec 2 11:14 myfile.gz
</code></pre>

Note: if you zip a file, the original file will be removed. If you unzip
a file, the compressed file will be removed. To keep both, we send the
data to `stdout` and redirect it to the target file:
<pre><code>$ <b>gzip -c myfile > myfile.gz</b>
$ <b>gunzip -c myfile.gz > myfile</b>
</code></pre>

### "zip" and "unzip"

Windows and macOS seem to favour the zip file format, so it's also
important to know how to unpack those. We do this using unzip:
<pre><code>$ <b>unzip myfile.zip</b>
</code></pre>

If we would like to make our own zip archive, we use zip:
<pre><code>$ <b>zip myfiles.zip myfile1 myfile2 myfile3</b>
</code></pre>

## Working with tarballs: "tar"

Tar stands for "tape archive" and is a way to bundle files together in a
bigger file.

You will normally want to unpack these files more often than you make
them. To unpack a `.tar` file you use:
<pre><code>$ <b>tar -xf tarfile.tar</b>
</code></pre>

Often, you will find `gzip` compressed `.tar` files on the web. These
are called tarballs. You can recognize them by the filename ending in
`.tar.gz`. You can uncompress these using `gunzip` and then unpacking
them using `tar`. But `tar` knows how to open them using the `-z`
option:
<pre><code>$ <b>tar -zxf tarfile.tar.gz</b>
$ <b>tar -zxf tarfile.tgz</b>
</code></pre>

### Order of arguments

Note: Archive programs like `zip`, `tar`, and `jar` use arguments in the
"opposite direction" of copy commands.
<pre><code># cp, ln: &lt;source(s)&gt; &lt;target&gt;
$ <b>cp source1 source2 source3 target</b>
$ <b>ln -s source target</b>

# zip, tar: &lt;target&gt; &lt;source(s)&gt;
$ <b>zip zipfile.zip source1 source2 source3</b>
$ <b>tar -cf tarfile.tar source1 source2 source3</b>
</code></pre>


If you use `tar` with the source files first then the first file will be
overwritten. You can control the order of arguments of `tar` if it helps
you remember:

<pre><code>$ <b>tar -c source1 source2 source3 -f tarfile.tar</b></code></pre>

## Exercises

1.  Create a subdirectory in your home directory named `test` containing
    a single, empty file named `one.txt`.

2.  Copy `/etc/hostname` into the `test` directory and then check what's
    in it. Rename the file to `hostname.txt`.

3.  Make a new directory named `another` and copy the entire `test`
    directory to it. `another/test/one.txt` should then be an empty
    file.

4.  Remove the `another/test` directory with a single command.

5.  Rename `test` to `test2`. Move `test2/hostname.txt` to your home
    directory.

6.  Change the permission of `test2` so only you can access it.

7.  Create an empty job script named `job.sh`, and make it executable.

8.  gzip `hostname.txt`, see how much smaller it becomes, then unzip it
    again.

The next [chapter](uploading_files.md) is on uploading files, especially important when using HPC-infrastructure.
