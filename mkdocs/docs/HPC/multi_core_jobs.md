# Multi core jobs/Parallel Computing 

## Why Parallel Programming?

There are two important motivations to engage in parallel programming.

1.  Firstly, the need to decrease the time to solution: distributing
    your code over *C* cores holds the promise of speeding up execution
    times by a factor *C*. All modern computers (and probably even your
    smartphone) are equipped with multi-core processors capable of
    parallel processing.

2.  The second reason is problem size: distributing your code over *N*
    nodes increases the available memory by a factor *N*, and thus holds
    the promise of being able to tackle problems which are *N* times
    bigger.

On a desktop computer, this enables a user to run multiple programs and
the operating system simultaneously. For scientific computing, this
means you have the ability in principle of splitting up your
computations into groups and running each group on its own core.

There are multiple different ways to achieve parallel programming. The
table below gives a (non-exhaustive) overview of problem independent
approaches to parallel programming. In addition there are many problem
specific libraries that incorporate parallel capabilities. The next
three sections explore some common approaches: (raw) threads, OpenMP and
MPI.

!!! tip
    You can request more nodes/cores by adding following line to your run script.
    ```
    #PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=10
    ```
    This queues a job that claims 2 nodes and 10 cores.

!!! warning
    Just requesting more nodes and/or cores does not mean that your job will automatically run faster.
    You can find more about this [here](troubleshooting.md#job_does_not_run_faster).

## Parallel Computing with threads

Multi-threading is a widespread programming and execution model that
allows multiple threads to exist within the context of a single process.
These threads share the process' resources, but are able to execute
independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a
useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multi-threading can also be
applied to a single process to enable parallel execution on a
multiprocessing system.

![Image](img/img0700.png)

This advantage of a multithreaded program allows it to operate faster on
computer systems that have multiple CPUs or across a cluster of machines
--- because the threads of the program naturally lend themselves to
truly concurrent execution. In such a case, the programmer needs to be
careful to avoid race conditions, and other non-intuitive behaviours. In
order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to
synchronise in time in order to process the data in the correct order.
Threads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often
implemented using semaphores) in order to prevent common data from being
simultaneously modified, or read while in the process of being modified.
Careless use of such primitives can lead to deadlocks.

Threads are a way that a program can spawn concurrent units of
processing that can then be delegated by the operating system to
multiple processing cores. Clearly the advantage of a multithreaded
program (one that uses multiple threads that are assigned to multiple
processing cores) is that you can achieve big speedups, as all cores of
your CPU (and all CPUs if you have more than one) are used at the same
time.

Here is a simple example program that spawns 5 threads, where each one
runs a simple function that only prints "Hello from thread".

Go to the example directory:

<pre><code><b>$ cd ~/{{ exampledir }}</b>
</code></pre>

!!! note
    If the example directory is not yet present, copy it to your home directory:

    <pre><code><b>$ cp -r {{ examplesdir }} ~/</b></code></pre>

Study the example first:

<div style="text-align: center;">-- T_hello.c --</div>

```C
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/T_hello.c" %}
```

And compile it (whilst including the thread library) and run and test it
on the login-node:

<pre><code><b>$ module load GCC</b>
<b>$ gcc -o T_hello T_hello.c -lpthread</b>
<b>$ ./T_hello</b>
spawning thread 0
spawning thread 1
spawning thread 2
Hello from thread 0!
Hello from thread 1!
Hello from thread 2!
spawning thread 3
spawning thread 4
Hello from thread 3!
Hello from thread 4!
</code></pre>

Now, run it on the cluster and check the output:

<pre><code><b>$ qsub T_hello.pbs</b>
{{ jobid }}
<b>$ more T_hello.pbs.o{{ jobid }}</b>
spawning thread 0
spawning thread 1
spawning thread 2
Hello from thread 0!
Hello from thread 1!
Hello from thread 2!
spawning thread 3
spawning thread 4
Hello from thread 3!
Hello from thread 4!
</code></pre>

## Parallel Computing with OpenMP

***OpenMP*** is an API that implements a multi-threaded, shared memory form of
parallelism. It uses a set of compiler directives (statements that you
add to your code and that are recognised by your Fortran/C/C++ compiler
if OpenMP is enabled or otherwise ignored) that are incorporated at
compile-time to generate a multi-threaded version of your code. You can
think of Pthreads (above) as doing multi-threaded programming "by hand",
and OpenMP as a slightly more automated, higher-level API to make your
program multithreaded. OpenMP takes care of many of the low-level
details that you would normally have to implement yourself, if you were
using Pthreads from the ground up.

An important advantage of OpenMP is that, because it uses compiler
directives, the original serial version stays intact, and minimal
changes (in the form of compiler directives) are necessary to turn a
working serial code into a working parallel code.

Here is the general code structure of an OpenMP program:
```C
#include <omp.h>
main ()  {
int var1, var2, var3;
// Serial code
// Beginning of parallel section. Fork a team of threads.
// Specify variable scoping

#pragma omp parallel private(var1, var2) shared(var3)
  {
  // Parallel section executed by all threads
  // All threads join master thread and disband
  }
// Resume serial code
}
```

### Private versus Shared variables

By using the private() and shared() clauses, you can specify variables
within the parallel region as being **shared**, i.e., visible and accessible by
all threads simultaneously, or **private**, i.e., private to each thread, meaning
each thread will have its own local copy. In the code example below for
parallelising a for loop, you can see that we specify the thread_id and
nloops variables as private.

### Parallelising for loops with OpenMP

Parallelising for loops is really simple (see code below). By default,
loop iteration counters in OpenMP loop constructs (in this case the i
variable) in the for loop are set to private variables.

<center>-- omp1.c --</center>

```C
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/omp1.c" %}
```

And compile it (whilst including the "*openmp*" library) and run and
test it on the login-node:

<pre><code><b>$ module load GCC</b>
<b>$ gcc -fopenmp -o omp1 omp1.c</b>
<b>$ ./omp1</b>
Thread 6 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 7 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 5 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 4 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 0 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 2 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 3 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 1 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
</code></pre>

Now run it in the cluster and check the result again.

<pre><code><b>$ qsub omp1.pbs</b>
<b>$ cat omp1.pbs.o*</b>
Thread 1 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 4 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 3 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 0 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 5 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 7 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 2 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
Thread 6 performed 125 iterations of the loop.
</code></pre>

### Critical Code

Using OpenMP you can specify something called a "critical" section of
code. This is code that is performed by all threads, but is only
performed **one thread at a time** (i.e., in serial). This provides a convenient way of letting
you do things like updating a global variable with local results from
each thread, and you don't have to worry about things like other threads
writing to that global variable at the same time (a collision).

<center>-- omp2.c --</center>

```C
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/omp2.c" %}
```

And compile it (whilst including the "*openmp*" library) and run and
test it on the login-node:

<pre><code><b>$ module load GCC</b>
<b>$ gcc -fopenmp -o omp2 omp2.c</b>
<b>$ ./omp2</b>
Thread 3 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (0), total is now 12500.
Thread 7 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (12500), total is now 25000.
Thread 5 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (25000), total is now 37500.
Thread 6 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (37500), total is now 50000.
Thread 2 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (50000), total is now 62500.
Thread 4 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (62500), total is now 75000.
Thread 1 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (75000), total is now 87500.
Thread 0 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (87500), total is now 100000.
Total # loop iterations is 100000
</code></pre>

Now run it in the cluster and check the result again.

<pre><code><b>$ qsub omp2.pbs</b>
<b>$ cat omp2.pbs.o*</b>
Thread 2 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (0), total is now 12500.
Thread 0 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (12500), total is now 25000.
Thread 1 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (25000), total is now 37500.
Thread 4 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (37500), total is now 50000.
Thread 7 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (50000), total is now 62500.
Thread 3 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (62500), total is now 75000.
Thread 5 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (75000), total is now 87500.
Thread 6 is adding its iterations (12500) to sum (87500), total is now 100000.
Total # loop iterations is 100000
</code></pre>

### Reduction

Reduction refers to the process of combining the results of several
sub-calculations into a final result. This is a very common paradigm
(and indeed the so-called "map-reduce" framework used by Google and
others is very popular). Indeed we used this paradigm in the code
example above, where we used the "critical code" directive to accomplish
this. The map-reduce paradigm is so common that OpenMP has a specific
directive that allows you to more easily implement this.

<div style="text-align: center;">-- omp3.c --</div>

```C
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/omp3.c" %}
```

And compile it (whilst including the "*openmp*" library) and run and
test it on the login-node:

<pre><code><b>$ module load GCC</b>
<b>$ gcc -fopenmp -o omp3 omp3.c</b>
<b>$ ./omp3</b>
Total # loop iterations is 100000
</code></pre>

Now run it in the cluster and check the result again.

<pre><code><b>$ qsub omp3.pbs</b>
<b>$ cat omp3.pbs.o*</b>
Total # loop iterations is 100000
</code></pre>

### Other OpenMP directives

There are a host of other directives you can issue using OpenMP.

Some other clauses of interest are:

1.  barrier: each thread will wait until all threads have reached this
    point in the code, before proceeding

2.  nowait: threads will not wait until everybody is finished

3.  schedule(type, chunk) allows you to specify how tasks are spawned
    out to threads in a for loop. There are three types of scheduling
    you can specify

4.  if: allows you to parallelise only if a certain condition is met

5.  ... and a host of others

## Parallel Computing with MPI

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standard defining core syntax
and semantics of library routines that can be used to implement parallel
programming in C (and in other languages as well). There are several
implementations of MPI such as Open MPI, Intel MPI, M(VA)PICH and
LAM/MPI.

In the context of this tutorial, you can think of MPI, in terms of its
complexity, scope and control, as sitting in between programming with
Pthreads, and using a high-level API such as OpenMP. For a Message
Passing Interface (MPI) application, a parallel task usually consists of
a single executable running concurrently on multiple processors, with
communication between the processes. This is shown in the following
diagram:


![Image](img/img0701.png){ style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" }

The process numbers 0, 1 and 2 represent the process rank and have
greater or less significance depending on the processing paradigm. At
the minimum, Process 0 handles the input/output and determines what
other processes are running.

The MPI interface allows you to manage allocation, communication, and
synchronisation of a set of processes that are mapped onto multiple
nodes, where each node can be a core within a single CPU, or CPUs within
a single machine, or even across multiple machines (as long as they are
networked together).

One context where MPI shines in particular is the ability to easily take
advantage not just of multiple cores on a single machine, but to run
programs on clusters of several machines. Even if you don't have a
dedicated cluster, you could still write a program using MPI that could
run your program in parallel, across any collection of computers, as
long as they are networked together.

Here is a "Hello World" program in MPI written in C. In this example, we
send a "Hello" message to each processor, manipulate it trivially,
return the results to the main process, and print the messages.

Study the MPI-programme and the PBS-file:

<div style="text-align: center;">-- mpi_hello.c --</div>

```C
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/mpi_hello.c" %}
```

<div style="text-align: center;">-- mpi_hello.pbs --</div>

```bash
{% include "./examples/Multi_core_jobs_Parallel_Computing/mpi_hello.pbs" %}
```

and compile it:

<pre><code><b>$ module load intel</b>
<b>$ mpiicc -o mpi_hello mpi_hello.c</b>
</code></pre>

mpiicc is a wrapper of the Intel C++ compiler icc to compile MPI
programs (see [the chapter on compilation](./compiling_your_software.md) for details).

Run the parallel program:

<pre><code><b>$ qsub mpi_hello.pbs</b>
<b>$ ls -l</b>
total 1024
-rwxrwxr-x 1 {{ userid }} 8746 Sep 16 14:19 mpi_hello*
-rw-r--r-- 1 {{ userid }} 1626 Sep 16 14:18 mpi_hello.c

-rw-r--r-- 1 {{ userid }}  304 Sep 16 14:22 mpi_hello.pbs
<b>$ cat mpi_hello.o{{ jobid }}</b>
0: We have 16 processors
0: Hello 1! Processor 1 reporting for duty

0: Hello 13! Processor 13 reporting for duty
0: Hello 14! Processor 14 reporting for duty
0: Hello 15! Processor 15 reporting for duty
</code></pre>

The runtime environment for the MPI implementation used (often called
mpirun or mpiexec) spawns multiple copies of the program, with the total
number of copies determining the number of process *ranks* in
MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is an opaque descriptor for communication between
the set of processes. A single process, multiple data (SPMD = Single
Program, Multiple Data) programming model is thereby facilitated, but
not required; many MPI implementations allow multiple, different,
executables to be started in the same MPI job. Each process has its own
rank, the total number of processes in the world, and the ability to
communicate between them either with point-to-point (send/receive)
communication, or by collective communication among the group. It is
enough for MPI to provide an SPMD-style program with MPI_COMM_WORLD, its
own rank, and the size of the world to allow algorithms to decide what
to do. In more realistic situations, I/O is more carefully managed than
in this example. MPI does not guarantee how POSIX I/O would actually
work on a given system, but it commonly does work, at least from rank 0.

MPI uses the notion of process rather than processor. Program copies are
*mapped* to processors by the MPI runtime. In that sense, the parallel
machine can map to 1 physical processor, or N where N is the total
number of processors available, or something in between. For maximum
parallel speedup, more physical processors are used. This example
adjusts its behaviour to the size of the world N, so it also seeks to
scale to the runtime configuration without compilation for each size
variation, although runtime decisions might vary depending on that
absolute amount of concurrency available.

{% if site == gent %}
!!! tip
    mpirun does not always do the optimal core pinning and requires a few
    extra arguments to be the most efficient possible on a given system. At
    Ghent we have a wrapper around `mpirun` called `mympirun`. See for more
    information.

    You will generally just start an MPI program on the by using `mympirun`
    instead of
    `mpirun -n <nr of cores> <--other settings> <--other optimisations>`
