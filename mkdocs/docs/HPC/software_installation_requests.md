- On which system(s) did you use this software?
- Is the software working as it should? If not, please elaborate.
- Is the performance of the software as you expect it to be? If not, please elaborate (and consider reporting problems).
- How often will you be using this software going forward?
- Describe how this software will help you with future research output.
- Provide an example of how to use this software, including the necessary information to run this example (where to get the input files, etc.), so we can consider documenting its usage.

!!! abstract "Timing"
    Please provide the report **no later than 1 month** after the completion of the software installation.

Take into account the following guidelines:

* Make sure to use the correct ticket number in [the form to submit a software usage report](https://login.hpc.ugent.be/pun/sys/dashboard/support?category=swreport);
* Keep it concise: a couple of sentences per answer is sufficient;
* Please submit **one software usage report per ticket** that corresponds to an installation request.
  Do not combine usage reports for multiple requests, unless you requested multiple (related) software installations in
  a single request (single ticket number).
