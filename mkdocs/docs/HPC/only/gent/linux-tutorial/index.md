# Introduction

Welcome to the Linux tutorial, a comprehensive guide designed to give you essential skills for smooth interaction within a Linux environment.

These skills are important to the {{ hpcinfra }}, which operates on {{ operatingsystembase }}.
For more information see [introduction to HPC](https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/introduction).

The guide aims to make you familiar with the Linux command line environment quickly.

The tutorial goes though the following steps:

1. [Getting Started](getting_started.md)
2. [Navigating](navigating.md)
3. [Manipulating files and directories](manipulating_files_and_directories.md)
4. [Uploading files](uploading_files.md)
5. [Beyond the basics](beyond_the_basics.md)

Do not forget [Common pitfalls](common_pitfalls.md), as this can save you some troubleshooting.
