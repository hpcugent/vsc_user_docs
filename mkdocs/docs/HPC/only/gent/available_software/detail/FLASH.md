FLASH
=====


FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fastand accurate software tool to merge paired-end reads from next-generationsequencing experiments. FLASH is designed to merge pairs of reads when theoriginal DNA fragments are shorter than twice the length of reads. Theresulting longer reads can significantly improve genome assemblies. They canalso improve transcriptome assembly when FLASH is used to merge RNA-seq data.
