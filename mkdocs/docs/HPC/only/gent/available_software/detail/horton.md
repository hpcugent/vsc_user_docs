horton
======


HORTON is a Helpful Open-source Research TOol for N-fermion systems, written primarily in the Python programming language. (HORTON is named after the helpful pachyderm, not the Canadian caffeine supply store.) The ultimate goal of HORTON is to provide a platform for testing new ideas on the quantum many-body problem at a reasonable computational cost. Although HORTON is primarily designed to be a quantum-chemistry program, it can perform computations involving model Hamiltonians, and could be extended for computations in nuclear physics.
