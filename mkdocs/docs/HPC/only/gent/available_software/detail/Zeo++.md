Zeo++
=====


Zeo++ is a software package for analysis of crystalline porous materials.    Zeo++ can be used to perform geometry-based analysis of structure and    topology of the void space inside a material,    to assemble or alternate structures as well as to generate structure    representations to be used in structure similarity calculations.    Zeo++ can be used to either analyze a single structure or perform high-throughput analysis of a large database.
