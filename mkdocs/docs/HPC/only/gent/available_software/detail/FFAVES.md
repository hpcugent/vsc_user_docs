FFAVES
======


Functional Feature Amplification Via Entropy Sorting (FFAVES).Use FFAVES to amplify the signal of groups of co-regulating genes in an unsupervised, multivariate manner.By amplifying the signal of genes with correlated expression, while filtering out genes that are randomly expressed,we can identify a subset of genes more predictive of different cell types.The output of FFAVES can then be used in our second algorithm, entropy sort feature weighting (ESFW),to create a ranked list of genes that are most likely to pertain to distinct sub-populations of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset.
