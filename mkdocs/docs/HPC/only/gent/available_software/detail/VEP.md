VEP
===


Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) determines the effect of your variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions. Includes EnsEMBL-XS, which provides pre-compiled replacements for frequently used routines in VEP.
