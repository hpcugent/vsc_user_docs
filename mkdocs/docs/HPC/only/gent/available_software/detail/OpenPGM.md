OpenPGM
=======


OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of reception responsibility.
