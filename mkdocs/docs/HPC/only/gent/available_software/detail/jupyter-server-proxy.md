====================


Jupyter Server Proxy lets you run arbitrary external processes(such as RStudio, Shiny Server, Syncthing, PostgreSQL, Code Server, etc)alongside your notebook server and provide authenticated web access to them    using a path like /rstudio next to others like /lab. Alongside the pythonpackage that provides the main functionality, the JupyterLab extension(@jupyterlab/server-proxy) provides buttons in the JupyterLab launcher windowto get to RStudio for example.
