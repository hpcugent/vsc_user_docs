humann
======


HUMAnN v3 is a pipeline for efficiently and accurately determining the coverage and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data.Sequencing a metagenome typically produces millions of short DNA/RNA reads. This process, referred to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community and its members. More generally, functional profiling answers the question: What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?
