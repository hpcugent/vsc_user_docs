YACS
====


YACS was created as a lightweight library to define andmanage system configurations, such as those commonly found in softwaredesigned for scientific experimentation. These "configurations"typically cover concepts like hyperparameters used in training a machinelearning model or configurable model hyperparameters, such as the depthof a convolutional neural network.
