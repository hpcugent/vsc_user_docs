MaSuRCA
=======


MaSuRCA is whole genome assembly software. It combines the efficiency of the de Bruijn graph and Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC) approaches. MaSuRCA can assemble data sets containing only short reads from Illumina sequencing or a mixture of short reads and long reads (Sanger, 454, Pacbio and Nanopore).
