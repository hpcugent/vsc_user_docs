phyluce
=======


phyluce is a software package for working with data generated from sequence capture of UCE (ultra-conserved element) loci, as first published in [BCF2012]. Specifically, phyluce is a suite of programs to:1) assemble raw sequence reads from Illumina platforms into contigs2) determine which contigs represent UCE loci3) filter potentially paralagous UCE loci4) generate different sets of UCE loci across taxa of interest
