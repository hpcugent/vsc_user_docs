QCxMS
=====


QCxMS is a quantum chemical based program to calculate electron ionization (EI) and collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra using Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BO-MD). It is the successor of the QCEIMS program, in which the EI part is exchanged to x to account for the greater general applicibility of the program.
