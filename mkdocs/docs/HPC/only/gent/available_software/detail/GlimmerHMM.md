GlimmerHMM
==========


GlimmerHMM is a new gene finder based on a Generalized Hidden Markov Model. Although the gene finder conforms to the overall mathematical framework of a GHMM, additionally it incorporates splice site models adapted from the GeneSplicer program and a decision tree adapted from GlimmerM. It also utilizes Interpolated Markov Models for the coding and noncoding models.
