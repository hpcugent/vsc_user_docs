Elk
===


An all-electron full-potential linearisedaugmented-plane wave (FP-LAPW) code with many advanced features. Writtenoriginally at Karl-Franzens-Universit√§t Graz as a milestone of theEXCITING EU Research and Training Network, the code is designed to be assimple as possible so that new developments in the field of densityfunctional theory (DFT) can be added quickly and reliably.
