enchant-2
=========


Enchant aims to provide a simple but comprehensive abstraction for dealingwith different spell checking libraries in a consistent way. A client, suchas a text editor or word processor, need not know anything about a specificspell-checker, and since all back-ends are plugins, new spell-checkers canbe added without needing any change to the program using Enchant.
