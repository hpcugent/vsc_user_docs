HDBSCAN
=======


The hdbscan library is a suite of tools to use unsupervised learning to find clusters, or dense regions, of a dataset. The primary algorithm is HDBSCAN* as proposed by Campello, Moulavi, and Sander. The library provides a high performance implementation of this algorithm, along with tools for analysing the resulting clustering.
