The COIN-OR Cut Generation Library (Cgl) is a collection of cut generators thatcan be used with other COIN-OR packages that make use of cuts, such as, amongothers, the linear solver Clp or the mixed integer linear programming solversCbc or BCP. Cgl uses the abstract class OsiSolverInterface (see Osi) to use orcommunicate with a solver. It does not directly call a solver.
