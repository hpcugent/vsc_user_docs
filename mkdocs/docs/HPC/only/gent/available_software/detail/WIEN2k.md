WIEN2k
======


The program package WIEN2k allows to perform electronic structure calculations of solidsusing density functional theory (DFT). It is based on the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane-wave((L)APW) + local orbitals (lo) method, one among the most accurate schemes for band structure calculations.WIEN2k is an all-electron scheme including relativistic effects and has many features.
