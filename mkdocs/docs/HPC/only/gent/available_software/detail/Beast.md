Beast
=====


BEAST is a cross-platform program for Bayesian MCMC analysis of molecular  sequences. It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using  strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies  but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single  tree topology. BEAST uses MCMC to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted  proportional to its posterior probability.
