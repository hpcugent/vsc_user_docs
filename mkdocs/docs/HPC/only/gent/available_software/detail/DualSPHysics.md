DualSPHysics
============


DualSPHysics is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model named SPHysics. The code is developed to study free-surface flow phenomena where Eulerian methods can be difficult to apply, such as waves or impact of dam-breaks on off-shore structures. DualSPHysics is a set of C++, CUDA and Java codes designed to deal with real-life engineering problems.
