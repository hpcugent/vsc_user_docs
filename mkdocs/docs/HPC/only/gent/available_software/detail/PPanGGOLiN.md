PPanGGOLiN
==========


PPanGGOLiN is a software suite used to create and manipulate prokaryoticpangenomes from a set of either genomic DNA sequences or provided genome annotations. It is designedto scale up to tens of thousands of genomes. It has the specificity to partition the pangenome usinga statistical approach rather than using fixed thresholds which gives it the ability to work with low-qualitydata such as Metagenomic Assembled Genomes (MAGs) or Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) thus taking advantageof large scale environmental studies and letting users study the pangenome of uncultivable species.
