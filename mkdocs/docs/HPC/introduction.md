# Introduction to HPC
## What is HPC?

"**High Performance Computing**" (HPC) is computing on a "*Supercomputer*", a computer with at the
frontline of contemporary processing capacity -- particularly speed of
calculation and available memory.

While the supercomputers in the early days (around 1970) used only a few
processors, in the 1990s machines with thousands of processors began to
appear and, by the end of the 20th century, massively parallel
supercomputers with tens of thousands of "off-the-shelf" processors were
the norm. A large number of dedicated processors are placed in close
proximity to each other in a computer cluster.

A **computer cluster** consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work
together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.

The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through
fast local area networks ("LAN") with each *node* (computer used as a
server) running its own instance of an operating system. Computer
clusters emerged as a result of convergence of a number of computing
trends including the availability of low cost microprocessors,
high-speed networks, and software for high performance distributed
computing.

Compute clusters are usually deployed to improve performance and
availability over that of a single computer, while typically being more
cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or
availability.

Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational
science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive
tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather
forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular
modelling (computing the structures and properties of chemical
compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and
physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the
universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of
nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). [^1]

## What is the {{ hpcinfra }}?

The {{ hpc }} is a collection of computers with AMD and/or Intel CPUs, running a
Linux operating system, shaped like pizza boxes and stored above and
next to each other in racks, interconnected with copper and fiber
cables. Their number crunching power is (presently) measured in hundreds
of billions of floating point operations (gigaflops) and even in
teraflops.

## What the HPC infrastucture is *not*

The HPC infrastructure is *not* a magic computer that automatically:

1.  runs your PC-applications much faster for bigger problems;

2.  develops your applications;

3.  solves your bugs;

4.  does your thinking;

5.  ...

6.  allows you to play games even faster.

The {{ hpc }} does not replace your desktop computer.


## Is the {{ hpc }} a solution for my computational needs?

### Batch or interactive mode?

Typically, the strength of a supercomputer comes from its ability to run
a huge number of programs (i.e., executables) in parallel without any
user interaction in real time. This is what is called "running in batch
mode".

It is also possible to run programs at the {{ hpc }}, which require user
interaction. (pushing buttons, entering input data, etc.). Although
technically possible, the use of the {{ hpc }} might not always be the best and
smartest option to run those interactive programs. Each time some user
interaction is needed, the computer will wait for user input. The
available computer resources (CPU, storage, network, etc.) might not be
optimally used in those cases. A more in-depth analysis with the {{ hpc }} staff
can unveil whether the {{ hpc }} is the desired solution to run interactive
programs. Interactive mode is typically only useful for creating quick
visualisations of your data without having to copy your data to your
desktop and back.

### What are cores, processors and nodes?

In this manual, the terms core, processor and node will be frequently
used, so it's useful to understand what they are.

Modern servers, also referred to as *(worker)nodes* in the context of
HPC, include one or more sockets, each housing a multi-*core*
*processor* (next to memory, disk(s), network cards, ...). A modern
*processor* consists of multiple CPUs or *cores* that are used to
execute *computations*.

### Parallel or sequential programs? 

#### Parallel programs

**Parallel computing** is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out
simultaneously. They are based on the principle that large problems can
often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently
("in parallel").

Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at
which the hardware supports parallelism, with multicore computers having
multiple processing elements within a single machine, while clusters use
multiple computers to work on the same task. Parallel computing has
become the dominant computer architecture, mainly in the form of
multicore processors.

The two parallel programming paradigms most used in HPC are:

-   OpenMP for shared memory systems (multithreading): on multiple cores
    of a single node

-   MPI for distributed memory systems (multiprocessing): on multiple
    nodes

**Parallel programs** are more difficult to write than sequential ones, because concurrency
introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race
conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronisation
between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest
obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

#### Sequential programs

Sequential software does not do calculations in parallel, i.e., it only
uses *one single core of a single workernode*. **It does not become faster by just throwing more cores at it**: it can only use one
core.

It is perfectly possible to also run purely **sequential programs** on the {{ hpc }}.

Running your sequential programs on the most modern and fastest
computers in the {{ hpc }} can save you a lot of time. But it also might be
possible to run multiple instances of your program (e.g., with different
input parameters) on the {{ hpc }}, in order to solve one overall problem (e.g.,
to perform a parameter sweep). This is another form of running your
sequential programs in parallel.

### What programming languages can I use?

You can use *any* programming language, *any* software package and *any*
library provided it has a version that runs on Linux, specifically, on
the version of Linux that is installed on the compute nodes, {{ operatingsystem }}.

For the most common **programming languages**, a compiler is available on {{ operatingsystem }}. Supported and common
programming languages on the {{ hpc }} are C/C++, FORTRAN, Java, Perl, Python,
MATLAB, R, etc.

Supported and commonly used compilers are

Additional software can be installed "*on demand*". Please contact the {{ hpc }}
staff to see whether the {{ hpc }} can handle your specific requirements.

### What operating systems can I use? 

All nodes in the {{ hpc }} cluster run under {{ operatingsystem }}, which is a specific version of {{ operatingsystembase }}.
This means that all programs (executables) should be compiled for {{ operatingsystem }}.

Users can connect from any computer in the {{ university }} network to the {{ hpc }}, regardless
of the Operating System that they are using on their personal computer.
Users can use any of the common Operating Systems (such as Windows,
macOS or any version of Linux/Unix/BSD) and run and control their
programs on the {{ hpc }}.

A user does not need to have prior knowledge about Linux; all of the
required knowledge is explained in this tutorial.

### What does a typical workflow look like?

A typical workflow looks like:

1.  Connect to the login nodes with SSH (see [First Time connection to the HPC infrastructure](../connecting/#first-time-connection-to-the-hpc-infrastructure))

2.  Transfer your files to the cluster (see [Transfer Files to/from the HPC](../connecting/#transfer-files-tofrom-the-hpc))

3.  Optional: compile your code and test it (for compiling, see [Compiling and testing your software on the HPC]())

4.  Create a job script and submit your job (see [Running batch jobs]())

5.  Get some coffee and be patient:

    1.  Your job gets into the queue

    2.  Your job gets executed

    3.  Your job finishes

6.  Study the results generated by your jobs, either on the cluster or
    after downloading them locally.

### What is the next step? 

When you think that the {{ hpc }} is a useful tool to support your computational
needs, we encourage you to acquire a VSC-account (as explained in [Getting a HPC Account](../account)),
read [Connecting to the HPC infrastructure](../connecting), "Setting up the environment", and explore
chapters [Running interactive jobs]() to [Fine-tuning Job Specifications]() which will help you to transfer and run your programs on the {{ hpc }} cluster.

Do not hesitate to contact the {{ hpc }} staff for any help.
