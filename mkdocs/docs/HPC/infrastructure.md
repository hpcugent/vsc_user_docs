# Infrastructure

## Tier2 clusters of Ghent University

The Stevin computing infrastructure consists of several Tier2 clusters
which are hosted in the S10 datacenter of Ghent University.

This infrastructure is co-financed by FWO and Department of Economy,
Science and Innovation (EWI).

## Tier-2 login nodes

Log in to the HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure via [https://login.hpc.ugent.be](https://login.hpc.ugent.be)
or using SSH via `login.hpc.ugent.be`.

More info on using the web portal you can find [here](web_portal.md),
and about connection with SSH [here](connecting.md).

## Tier-2 compute clusters

### CPU clusters

The HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure currently included several standard
CPU-only clusters, of different generations (listed from old to new).

For basic information on using these clusters, see our
[documentation](running_batch_jobs.md).

| ***cluster name*** | ***# nodes*** | ***Processor architecture*** | ***Usable memory/node*** | ***Local diskspace/node*** | ***Interconnect*** | ***Operating system*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| doduo (default cluster) | 128 | 2x 48-core AMD EPYC 7552 (Rome @ 2.2 GHz) | 250 GiB | 180GB SSD | HDR-100 InfiniBand | RHEL 9 |
| gallade | 16 | 2x 64-core AMD EPYC 7773X (Milan-X @ 2.2 GHz) | 940 GiB | 1.5 TB NVME | HDR-100 InfiniBand | RHEL 9 |
| shinx | 48 | 2x 96-core AMD EPYC 9654 (Genoa @ 2.4 GHz) | 370 GiB | 500GB NVME | NDR-200 InfiniBand | RHEL 9 |

### Interactive debug cluster


A special-purpose interactive debug cluster is available,
where you should always be able to get a job running quickly,
**without waiting in the queue**.

Intended usage is mainly for interactive work,
either via an interactive job or using the [HPC-UGent web portal](web_portal.md).

This cluster is heavily over-provisioned, so jobs may
run slower if the cluster is used more heavily.

Strict limits are in place per user:

 * max. 5 jobs in queue
 * max. 3 jobs running
 * max. of 8 cores and 27GB of memory in total for running jobs

For more information, see our [documentation](interactive_debug.md).

| ***cluster name*** | ***# nodes*** | ***Processor architecture*** | ***Usable memory/node*** | ***Local diskspace/node*** | ***Interconnect*** | ***Operating system*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| donphan (*) | 16 | 2 x 18-core Intel Xeon Gold 6240 (Cascade Lake @ 2.6 GHz) + 1x shared NVIDIA Ampere A2 GPU (16GB GPU memory) | 738 GiB | 	1.6 TB NVME | HDR-100 Infiniband | RHEL 9 |

### GPU clusters

GPU clusters are available in the HPC-UGent Tier-2 infrastructure,
with different generations of NVIDIA GPUs.

These are well suited for specific workloads, with software that
can leverage the GPU resources (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, GROMACS, AlphaFold, etc.).

For more information on using these clusters, see our documentation.

| ***cluster name*** | ***# nodes*** | ***Processor architecture & GPUs*** | ***Usable memory/node*** | ***Local diskspace/node*** | ***Interconnect*** | ***Operating system*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| joltik | 10 | 2x 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6242 (Cascade Lake @ 2.8 GHz) + 4x NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs (32GB GPU memory) | 256 GiB | 800GB SSD | double EDR Infiniband | RHEL 9 |
| accelgor | 9 | 2x 24-core AMD EPYC 7413 (Milan @ 2.2 GHz) + 4x NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPUs (80GB GPU memory) | 500 GiB | 180GB SSD | HDR InfiniBand | RHEL 9 |
| litleo | 8 | 1x 48 core AMD EPYC 9454P (Genoa @ 2.75 GHz) + 2x NVIDIA H100 NVL (96GB GPU memory) | 315 GiB | 1.4TB SSD | NDR-200 Infiniband | RHEL 9 |

## Tier-2 shared storage

| ***Filesystem name*** | ***Intended usage*** | ***Total storage space*** | ***Personal storage space*** | ***VO storage space (^)*** |
| ---| --- |---| --- | --- |
| $VSC_HOME | Home directory, entry point to the system | 90 TB | 3GB (fixed) | (none) |
| $VSC_DATA | Long-term storage of large data files | 1.9 PB | 25GB (fixed) |  250GB |
| $VSC_SCRATCH | Temporary fast storage of 'live' data for calculations | 1.7 PB | 25GB (fixed) | 250GB |
| $VSC_SCRATCH_ARCANINE | Temporary very fast storage of 'live' data for calculations (recommended for very I/O-intensive jobs) | 70 TB NVME | (none) 	| upon request |


^ Storage space for a group of users (Virtual Organisation or VO for short) can be
increased significantly on request. For more information, see our
[documentation](running_jobs_with_input_output_data.md#virtual-organisations).
