## Environment Variables in Batch Job Scripts

TORQUE-related environment variables in batch job scripts.

```bash
# Using PBS - Environment Variables:
# When a batch job starts execution, a number of environment variables are
# predefined, which include:
#
#      Variables defined on the execution host.
#      Variables exported from the submission host with
#                -v (selected variables) and -V (all variables).
#      Variables defined by PBS.
#
# The following reflect the environment where the user ran qsub:
# PBS_O_HOST    The host where you ran the qsub command.
# PBS_O_LOGNAME Your user ID where you ran qsub.
# PBS_O_HOME    Your home directory where you ran qsub.
# PBS_O_WORKDIR The working directory where you ran qsub.
#
# These reflect the environment where the job is executing:
# PBS_ENVIRONMENT       Set to PBS_BATCH to indicate the job is a batch job,
#         or to PBS_INTERACTIVE to indicate the job is a PBS interactive job.
# PBS_O_QUEUE   The original queue you submitted to.
# PBS_QUEUE     The queue the job is executing from.
# PBS_JOBID     The job's PBS identifier.
# PBS_JOBNAME   The job's name.
```

***IMPORTANT!!*** All PBS directives MUST come before the first line of executable code in
your script, otherwise they will be ignored.

When a batch job is started, a number of environment variables are
created that can be used in the batch job script. A few of the most
commonly used variables are described here.
