The first time you make a connection to the login node, a Security
Alert will appear and you will be asked to verify the authenticity of the
login node.

Make sure the fingerprint in the alert matches one of the following:
<pre><code>{{ puttyFirstConnect }}</code></pre>

If it does, press ***Yes***, if it doesn't, please contact {{ hpcinfo }}.
