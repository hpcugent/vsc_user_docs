\label{ch:useful-linux-commands}

\section{Basic Linux Usage}

All the \hpc clusters run some variant of the ``\operatingsystembase'' operating system.  This
means that, when you connect to one of them, you get a command line interface,
which looks something like this:

\begin{prompt}
%\userid{}%@ln01[203] $
\end{prompt}

When you see this, we also say you are inside a ``shell''. The shell will accept
your commands, and execute them.

\begin{tabular}{|p{\dimexpr 0.15\textwidth-2\tabcolsep}|p{\dimexpr 0.85\textwidth-2\tabcolsep}|} \hline
ls   & Shows you a list of files in the current directory \\ \hline
cd   & Change current working directory \\ \hline
rm   & Remove file or directory \\ \hline
\ifgent
nano  & Text editor \\ \hline
\else
joe  & Text editor \\ \hline
\fi
echo & Prints its parameters to the screen \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Most commands will accept or even need parameters, which are placed after the
command, separated by spaces. A simple example with the ``echo'' command:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{echo This is a test}%
This is a test
\end{prompt}

Important here is the ``\$'' sign in front of the first line. This should not be
typed, but is a convention meaning ``the rest of this line should be typed at
your shell prompt''. The lines not starting with the ``\$'' sign are usually the
feedback or output from the command.

More commands will be used in the rest of this text, and will be explained then
if necessary. If not, you can usually get more information about a command, say
the item or command ``ls'', by trying either of the following:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{ls --help}%
%\shellcmd{man ls}%
%\shellcmd{info ls}%
\end{prompt}

(You can exit the last two ``manuals'' by using the ``q'' key.)

\section{How to get started with shell scripts}

In a shell script, you will put the commands you would normally type at your
shell prompt in the same order. This will enable you to execute all those
commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.

Scripts are basically non-compiled pieces of code: they are just text files.
Since they don't contain machine code, they are executed by what is called a
``parser'' or an ``interpreter''. This is another program that understands the
command in the script, and converts them to machine code. There are many kinds
of scripting languages, including Perl and Python.

Another very common scripting language is shell scripting. In a shell script,
you will put the commands you would normally type at your shell prompt in the
same order. This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by
only issuing one command: starting the script.

Typically in the following examples they'll have on each line the next command
to be executed although it is possible to put multiple commands on one line. A
very simple example of a script may be:

\begin{code}{bash}
echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"
hostname
\end{code}

You can type both lines at your shell prompt, and the result will be the following:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
%\shellcmd{hostname}%
%\loginhost%
\end{prompt}

Suppose we want to call this script ``foo''. You open a new file for editing, and
name it ``foo'', and edit it with your favourite editor

\ifgent
\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{nano foo}%
\end{prompt}
\else
\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{vi foo}%
\end{prompt}
\fi

or use the following commands:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{echo "echo Hello! This is my hostname:" >{} foo}%
%\shellcmd{echo hostname >{}>{} foo}%
\end{prompt}

The easiest ways to run a script is by starting the interpreter and pass the
script as parameter. In case of our script, the interpreter may either be ``sh''
or ``bash'' (which are the same on the cluster). So start the script:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{bash foo}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
%\loginhost%
\end{prompt}

Congratulations, you just created and started your first shell script!

A more advanced way of executing your shell scripts is by making them
executable by their own, so without invoking the interpreter manually. The
system can not automatically detect which interpreter you want, so you need to
tell this in some way. The easiest way is by using the so called
``shebang''-notation, explicitly created for this function: you put the
following line on top of your shell script ``\#!/path/to/your/interpreter''.

You can find this path with the ``which'' command. In our case, since we use bash
as an interpreter, we get the following path:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{which bash}%
/bin/bash
\end{prompt}

We edit our script and change it with this information:

\begin{code}{bash}
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"
hostname
\end{code}

Note that the ``shebang'' must be the first line of your script! Now the
operating system knows which program should be started to run the script.

Finally, we tell the operating system that this script is now executable. For
this we change its file attributes:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{chmod +x foo}%
\end{prompt}

Now you can start your script by simply executing it:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{./foo}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
%\loginhost%
\end{prompt}

The same technique can be used for all other scripting languages, like Perl and Python.

Most scripting languages understand that lines beginning with ``\#'' are
comments, and should be ignored. If the language you want to use does not
ignore these lines, you may get strange results \ldots
