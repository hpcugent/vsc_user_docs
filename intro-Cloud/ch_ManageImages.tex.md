# Upload and manage images {#cha:upload-manage-images}

A virtual machine image, referred to in this document simply as an
image, is a single file that contains a virtual disk that has a bootable
operating system installed on it. Images are used to create virtual
machine instances within the cloud. The image files themselves are never
modified, but you can copy the image into a persistent instance (see
chapter 6.

As a user of the VSC cloud, you can upload and manage your own virtual
machine images. For information about creating image files, see the
[OpenStack Virtual Machine Image
Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/).

**Note:** Shared storage in the VSC cloud is connected to a separate network,
which is only accessible from within the OpenStack environment.
Therefore, if you want to access your VM from outside of OpenStack, and
use the shared storage at the same time, you must make sure your VM
image is configured use multiple network interface cards (NICs).

You can choose who can access an image you have created. The following
access policies for images exist:

**public**

Public images are provided by the VSC, and can be accessed by all
users.

**private**

If you create a private image, only members of the same project have
access.

**shared**

You can also choose to share your image with a list of other
projects.

**community**

Community images are user-created images which are freely accessible
to all other users.

**Note:** You can also use the **openstack** and **glance** command-line clients
or the Image service to manage images.
