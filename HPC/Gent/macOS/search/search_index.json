The table below gives a (non-exhaustive) overview of problem independent approaches to parallel programming. In addition there are many problem specific libraries that incorporate parallel capabilities.

Loops and task can be parallelized by simple insertion of compiler directives. Under the hood threads are used. Hybrid approaches exist which use OpenMP to parallelize the work load on each node and MPI (see below) for communication between nodes.                       Lightweight threads with clever scheduling, Intel TBB, Intel Cilk Plus                       C/C++                       Limited to shared memory systems, but may be combined with MPI.

These threads share the process' resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multi-threading can also be applied to a single process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.</p> <p></p> <p>This advantage of a multithreaded program allows it to operate faster on computer systems that have multiple CPUs or across a cluster of machines --- because the threads of the program naturally lend themselves to truly concurrent execution. In such a case, the programmer needs to be careful to avoid race conditions, and other non-intuitive behaviours. In order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to synchronise in time in order to process the data in the correct order. Threads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often implemented using semaphores) in order to prevent common data from being simultaneously modified, or read while in the process of being modified. Careless use of such primitives can lead to deadlocks.</p> <p>Threads are a way that a program can spawn concurrent units of processing that can then be delegated by the operating system to multiple processing cores.

A single process, multiple data (SPMD = Single Program, Multiple Data) programming model is thereby facilitated, but not required; many MPI implementations allow multiple, different, executables to be started in the same MPI job. Each process has its own rank, the total number of processes in the world, and the ability to communicate between them either with point-to-point (send/receive) communication, or by collective communication among the group. It is enough for MPI to provide an SPMD-style program with MPI_COMM_WORLD, its own rank, and the size of the world to allow algorithms to decide what to do. In more realistic situations, I/O is more carefully managed than in this example. MPI does not guarantee how POSIX I/O would actually work on a given system, but it commonly does work, at least from rank 0.</p> <p>MPI uses the notion of process rather than processor. Program copies are mapped to processors by the MPI runtime. In that sense, the parallel machine can map to 1 physical processor, or N where N is the total number of processors available, or something in between. For maximum parallel speedup, more physical processors are used. This example adjusts its behaviour to the size of the world N, so it also seeks to scale to the runtime configuration without compilation for each size variation, although runtime decisions might vary depending on that absolute amount of concurrency available.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>mpirun does not always do the optimal core pinning and requires a few extra arguments to be the most efficient possible on a given system. At Ghent we have a wrapper around <code>mpirun</code> called <code>mympirun</code>. See for more information.</p> <p>You will generally just start an MPI program on the by using <code>mympirun</code> instead of <code>mpirun -n &lt;nr of cores&gt; &lt;--other settings&gt; &lt;--other optimisations&gt;</code></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If you plan engaging in parallel programming using MPI, this book may prove useful: Parallel Programming with MPI.

A typical example is the iterative evaluation of a program over different input parameter values, often referred to as a \"parameter sweep\". A Parameter Sweep runs a job a specified number of times, as if we sweep the parameter values through a user defined range.</p> <p>Users then often want to submit a large numbers of jobs based on the same job script but with (i) slightly different parameters settings or with (ii) different input files.</p> <p>These parameter values can have many forms, we can think about a range (e.g., from 1 to 100), or the parameters can be stored line by line in a comma-separated file. The users want to run their job once for each instance of the parameter values.</p> <p>One option could be to launch a lot of separate individual small jobs (one for each parameter) on the cluster, but this is not a good idea. The cluster scheduler isn't meant to deal with tons of small jobs. Those huge amounts of small jobs will create a lot of overhead, and can slow down the whole cluster. It would be better to bundle those jobs in larger sets.

There is no guarantee on when a job will start, since it depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is the priority of the job, which is determined by:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Historical use: the aim is to balance usage over users, so     infrequent (in terms of total compute time used) users get a higher     priority</p> </li> <li> <p>Requested resources (amount of cores, walltime, memory, ...).     The more resources you request, the more likely it is the job(s) will     have to wait for a while until those resources become available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time waiting in queue: queued jobs get a higher priority over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>User limits: this avoids having a single user use the entire     cluster. This means that each user can only use a part of the     cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whether or not you are a member of a Virtual Organisation (VO).</p> <p>Each VO gets assigned a fair share target, which has a big impact on the job priority.

This can have a (strong) negative impact on the priority of your jobs compared to the jobs of users who are in a specific VO.</p> <p>See Virtual Organisations for more information on how to join a VO, or request the creation of a new VO if there is none yet for your research group.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Some other factors are how busy the cluster is, how many workernodes are active, the resources (e.g., number of cores, memory) provided by each workernode, ...</p> <p>It might be beneficial to request less resources (e.g., not requesting all cores in a workernode), since the scheduler often finds a \"gap\" to fit the job into more easily.</p> <p>Sometimes it happens that couple of nodes are free and a job would not start. Empty nodes are not necessary empty for your job(s). Just imagine, that an N-node-job (with a higher priority than your waiting job(s)) should run.

We don't guarantee that these policies remain forever, and may change them if this seems necessary for the healthy operation of the cluster.</p> <p>Each type of scratch has its own use:</p> <p>Node scratch ($VSC_SCRATCH_NODE).   Every node has its own scratch space, which is completely separated     from the other nodes. On some clusters, it will be on a local disk     in the node, while on other clusters it will be emulated through     another file server. In many cases, it will be significantly slower     than the cluster scratch as it typically consists of just a single     disk. Some drawsbacks are that the storage can only be accessed on that     particular node and that the capacity is often very limited (e.g.,     100 GB). The performance will depend a lot on the particular     implementation in the cluster. In many cases, it will be     significantly slower than the cluster scratch as it typically     consists of just a single disk.

To allow a job running on multiple nodes (or multiple jobs running     on separate nodes) to share data as files, every node of the cluster     (including the login nodes) has access to this shared scratch     directory. Just like the home and data directories, every user has     its own scratch directory. Because this scratch is also available     from the login nodes, you could manually copy results to your data     directory after your job has ended. Also, this type of scratch is     usually implemented by running tens or hundreds of disks in parallel     on a powerful file server with fast connection to all the cluster     nodes and therefore is often the fastest file system available on a     cluster.

There are various factors that determine to what extent these extra resources can be used and how efficiently they can be used.  More information on this in the subsections below.</p>"}, {"location": "troubleshooting/#using-multiple-cores", "title": "Using multiple cores", "text": "<p>When you want to speed up your jobs by requesting multiple cores, you also need to use software that is actually capable of  using them (and use them efficiently, ideally). Unless particular a parallel programming paradigm like OpenMP threading  (shared memory) or MPI (distributed memory) is used,  software will run sequentially (on a single core).</p> <p>To use multiple cores, the software needs to be able to create, manage, and synchronize multiple threads or processes.  More on how to implement parallelization for you exact programming language can be found online. Note that when using software that only uses threads to use multiple cores, there is no point in asking for multiple nodes,  since with a multi-threading (shared memory) approach you can only use the resources (cores, memory) of a single node.</p> <p>Even if your software is able to use multiple cores, maybe there is no point in going beyond a single core or a handful of cores,  for example because the workload you are running is too small or does not parallelize well. You can test this by increasing the amount of cores step-wise, and look at the speedup you gain. For example,  test with 2, 4, 16, a quarter of, half of, and all available cores.</p> <p>Other reasons why using more cores may not lead to a (significant) speedup include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Overhead: When you use multi-threading (OpenMP) or multi-processing (MPI),  you should not expect that doubling the amount of cores will result in a 2x speedup.  This is due to the fact that time is needed to create, manage and synchronize the threads/processes. When this \"bookkeeping\" overhead exceeds the time gained by parallelization, you will not observe any speedup (or even see slower runs). For example, this can happen when you split you program in too many (tiny) tasks to run in parallel -  creating a thread/process for each task may even take longer than actually running the task itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amdahl's Law is often used in parallel computing to predict the maximum achievable (theoretical) speedup when using multiple cores.  It states that \"the overall performance improvement gained by optimizing a single part of a system is limited by the fraction of time that the improved part is actually used\".  For example, if a program needs 20 hours to complete using a single core, but a one-hour portion of the program can not be parallelized,  only the remaining 19 hours of execution time can be sped up using parallelization.  Regardless of how many cores are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time is always more than 1 hour.  So when you reach this theoretical limit, using more cores will not help at all to speed up the computational workload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource contention: When two or more threads/processes want to access the same resource, they need to wait on each other - this is called resource contention.  As a result, 1 thread/process will need to wait until the other one is is finished using that resource.  When each thread uses the same resource, it will definitely run slower than if it doesn't need to wait for other threads to finish.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software limitations: It is possible that the software you are using is just not really optimized for parallelization.  An example of a software that is not really optimized for multi-threading is Python (although this has improved over the years). This is due to the fact that in Python threads are implemented in a way that multiple threads can not run at the same time, due to the global interpreter lock (GIL).  Instead of using multi-threading in Python to speedup a CPU bound program, you should use multi-processing instead,  which uses multiple processes (multiple instances of the same program) instead of multiple threads in a single program instance. Using multiple processes can speed up your CPU bound programs a lot more in Python than threads can do, even though they are much less efficient to create. In other programming languages (which don't have a GIL), you would probably still want to use threads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Affinity and core pinning:  Even when the software you are using is able to efficiently use multiple cores, you may not see any speedup (or even a significant slowdown). This could be due to threads or processes that are not pinned to specific cores and keep hopping around between cores,  or because the pinning is done incorrectly and several threads/processes are being pinned to the same core(s), and thus keep \"fighting\" each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of sufficient memory: When there is not enough memory available, or not enough memory bandwidth,  it is likely that you will not see a significant speedup when using more cores (since each thread or process most likely requires additional memory).</p> </li> </ul> <p>More info on running multi-core workloads on the HPC-UGent infrastructure can be found here.</p>"}, {"location": "troubleshooting/#using-multiple-nodes", "title": "Using multiple nodes", "text": "<p>When trying to use multiple (worker)nodes to improve the performance of your workloads, you may not see (significant) speedup.</p> <p>Parallelizing code across nodes is fundamentally different from leveraging multiple cores via multi-threading within a single node. The scalability achieved through multi-threading does not extend seamlessly to distributing computations across multiple nodes. This means that just changing <code>#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=10</code> to <code>#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=10</code> may only increase the waiting time to get your job running (because twice as many resources are requested), and will not improve the execution time.</p> <p>Actually using additional nodes is not as straightforward as merely asking for multiple nodes when submitting your job. The resources on these additional nodes often need to discovered, managed, and synchronized. This introduces complexities in distributing work effectively across the nodes. Luckily, there exist some libraries that do this for you.</p> <p>Using the resources of multiple nodes is often done using an Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. MPI allows nodes to communicate and coordinate, but it also introduces additional complexity.</p> <p>An example of how you can make beneficial use of multiple nodes can be found here.</p> <p>You can also use MPI in Python, some useful packages that are also available on the HPC are:</p> <ul> <li>mpi4py</li> <li>Boost.MPI</li> </ul> <p>We advise to maximize core utilization before considering using multiple nodes.

This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.</p> <p>Scripts are basically non-compiled pieces of code: they are just text files. Since they don't contain machine code, they are executed by what is called a \"parser\" or an \"interpreter\". This is another program that understands the command in the script, and converts them to machine code. There are many kinds of scripting languages, including Perl and Python.</p> <p>Another very common scripting language is shell scripting. In a shell script, you will put the commands you would normally type at your shell prompt in the same order. This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.</p> <p>Typically in the following examples they'll have on each line the next command to be executed although it is possible to put multiple commands on one line. A very simple example of a script may be:</p> <pre><code>echo \"Hello! This is my hostname:\" \nhostname\n</code></pre> <p>You can type both lines at your shell prompt, and the result will be the following:</p> <pre><code>$ echo \"Hello! This is my hostname:\"\nHello! This is my hostname:\n$ hostname\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>Suppose we want to call this script \"foo\". You open a new file for editing, and name it \"foo\", and edit it with your favourite editor</p> <pre><code>$ nano foo\n</code></pre> <p>or use the following commands:</p> <pre><code>$ echo \"echo Hello! This is my hostname:\" &gt; foo\n$ echo hostname &gt;&gt; foo\n</code></pre> <p>The easiest ways to run a script is by starting the interpreter and pass the script as parameter. In case of our script, the interpreter may either be \"sh\" or \"bash\" (which are the same on the cluster). So start the script:</p> <pre><code>$ bash foo\nHello! This is my hostname:\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>Congratulations, you just created and started your first shell script!</p> <p>A more advanced way of executing your shell scripts is by making them executable by their own, so without invoking the interpreter manually. The system can not automatically detect which interpreter you want, so you need to tell this in some way. The easiest way is by using the so called \"shebang\" notation, explicitly created for this function: you put the following line on top of your shell script \"#!/path/to/your/interpreter\".</p> <p>You can find this path with the \"which\" command. In our case, since we use bash as an interpreter, we get the following path:</p> <pre><code>$ which bash\n/bin/bash\n</code></pre> <p>We edit our script and change it with this information:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash echo \\\"Hello! This is my hostname:\\\" hostname\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the \"shebang\" must be the first line of your script! Now the operating system knows which program should be started to run the script.</p> <p>Finally, we tell the operating system that this script is now executable. For this we change its file attributes:</p> <pre><code>$  chmod +x foo\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can start your script by simply executing it:</p> <pre><code>$ ./foo\nHello! This is my hostname:\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>The same technique can be used for all other scripting languages, like Perl and Python.</p> <p>Most scripting languages understand that lines beginning with \"#\" are comments, and should be ignored. If the language you want to use does not ignore these lines, you may get strange results ...</p>"}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#linux-quick-reference-guide", "title": "Linux Quick reference Guide", "text": ""}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#archive-commands", "title": "Archive Commands", "text": "tar                    An archiving program designed to store and extract files from an archive known as a tar file.                     tar -cvf foo.tar foo/                    compress the contents of foo folder to foo.tar                     tar -xvf foo.tar                    extract foo.tar                     tar -xvzf foo.tar.gz                    extract gzipped foo.tar.gz"}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#basic-commands", "title": "Basic Commands", "text": "ls                    Shows you a list of files in the current directory                     cd                    Change the current directory                     rm                    Remove file or directory                     mv                    Move file or directory                     echo                    Display a line or text                     pwd                    Print working directory                     mkdir                    Create directories                     rmdir                    Remove directories"}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#editor", "title": "Editor", "text": "emacs                     nano                    Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone                     vi                    A programmers text editor"}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#file-commands", "title": "File Commands", "text": "cat                     Read one or more files and print them to standard output                     cmp                    Compare two files byte by byte                     cp                    Copy files from a source to the same or different target(s)                     du                    Estimate disk usage of each file and recursively for directories                     find                    Search for files in directory hierarchy                     grep                    Print lines matching a pattern                     ls                    List directory contents                     mv                    Move file to different targets                     rm                    Remove files                     sort                    Sort lines of text files                     wc                    Print the number of new lines, words, and bytes in files"}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#help-commands", "title": "Help Commands", "text": "man                    Displays the manual page of a command with its name, synopsis, description, author, copyright etc."}, {"location": "useful_linux_commands/#network-commands", "title": "Network Commands", "text": "hostname                    show or set the system's host name                     ifconfig                    Display the current configuration of the network interface.
