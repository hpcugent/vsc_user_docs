All modern computers (and probably even your     smartphone) are equipped with multi-core processors capable of     parallel processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second reason is problem size: distributing your code over N     nodes increases the available memory by a factor N, and thus holds     the promise of being able to tackle problems which are N times     bigger.</p> </li> </ol> <p>On a desktop computer, this enables a user to run multiple programs and the operating system simultaneously. For scientific computing, this means you have the ability in principle of splitting up your computations into groups and running each group on its own core.</p> <p>There are multiple different ways to achieve parallel programming. The table below gives a (non-exhaustive) overview of problem independent approaches to parallel programming. In addition there are many problem specific libraries that incorporate parallel capabilities. The next three sections explore some common approaches: (raw) threads, OpenMP and MPI.</p> Tool Available languages binding Limitations Raw threads (pthreads, boost::threading, ...) Threading libraries are available for all common programming languages Threading libraries are available for all common programming languages &amp; Threads are limited to shared memory systems. They are more often used on single node systems rather than for HPC. Thread management is hard. OpenMP Fortran/C/C++ Limited to shared memory systems, but large shared memory systems for HPC are not uncommon (e.g., SGI UV). Loops and task can be parallelized by simple insertion of compiler directives. Under the hood threads are used. Hybrid approaches exist which use OpenMP to parallelize the work load on each node and MPI (see below) for communication between nodes. Lightweight threads with clever scheduling, Intel TBB, Intel Cilk Plus C/C++ Limited to shared memory systems, but may be combined with MPI. Thread management is taken care of by a very clever scheduler enabling the programmer to focus on parallelization itself. Hybrid approaches exist which use TBB and/or Cilk Plus to parallelise the work load on each node and MPI (see below) for communication between nodes. MPI Fortran/C/C++, Python Applies to both distributed and shared memory systems. Cooperation between different nodes or cores is managed by explicit calls to library routines handling communication routines. Global Arrays library C/C++, Python Mimics a global address space on distributed memory systems, by distributing arrays over many nodes and one sided communication. This library is used a lot for chemical structure calculation codes and was used in one of the first applications that broke the PetaFlop barrier. <p>Tip</p> <p>You can request more nodes/cores by adding following line to your run script. <pre><code>#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=10\n</code></pre> This queues a job that claims 2 nodes and 10 cores.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Just requesting more nodes and/or cores does not mean that your job will automatically run faster.

These threads share the process' resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. Multi-threading can also be applied to a single process to enable parallel execution on a multiprocessing system.</p> <p></p> <p>This advantage of a multithreaded program allows it to operate faster on computer systems that have multiple CPUs or across a cluster of machines --- because the threads of the program naturally lend themselves to truly concurrent execution. In such a case, the programmer needs to be careful to avoid race conditions, and other non-intuitive behaviours. In order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to synchronise in time in order to process the data in the correct order. Threads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often implemented using semaphores) in order to prevent common data from being simultaneously modified, or read while in the process of being modified. Careless use of such primitives can lead to deadlocks.</p> <p>Threads are a way that a program can spawn concurrent units of processing that can then be delegated by the operating system to multiple processing cores.

A single process, multiple data (SPMD = Single Program, Multiple Data) programming model is thereby facilitated, but not required; many MPI implementations allow multiple, different, executables to be started in the same MPI job. Each process has its own rank, the total number of processes in the world, and the ability to communicate between them either with point-to-point (send/receive) communication, or by collective communication among the group. It is enough for MPI to provide an SPMD-style program with MPI_COMM_WORLD, its own rank, and the size of the world to allow algorithms to decide what to do. In more realistic situations, I/O is more carefully managed than in this example. MPI does not guarantee how POSIX I/O would actually work on a given system, but it commonly does work, at least from rank 0.</p> <p>MPI uses the notion of process rather than processor. Program copies are mapped to processors by the MPI runtime. In that sense, the parallel machine can map to 1 physical processor, or N where N is the total number of processors available, or something in between. For maximum parallel speedup, more physical processors are used. This example adjusts its behaviour to the size of the world N, so it also seeks to scale to the runtime configuration without compilation for each size variation, although runtime decisions might vary depending on that absolute amount of concurrency available.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>mpirun does not always do the optimal core pinning and requires a few extra arguments to be the most efficient possible on a given system.

You should always specify the <code>module load</code> statements that are required for your job in the job script itself.</p> <p>To faciliate this, you can use a pre-defined module collection which you can restore using <code>module restore</code>, see the section on Save and load collections of modules for more information.</p> <p>Your job is now waiting in the queue for a free workernode to start on.</p> <p>Go and drink some coffee ...\u00a0but not too long.

There is no guarantee on when a job will start, since it depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is the priority of the job, which is determined by:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Historical use: the aim is to balance usage over users, so     infrequent (in terms of total compute time used) users get a higher     priority</p> </li> <li> <p>Requested resources (amount of cores, walltime, memory, ...).     The more resources you request, the more likely it is the job(s) will     have to wait for a while until those resources become available.</p> </li> <li> <p>Time waiting in queue: queued jobs get a higher priority over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>User limits: this avoids having a single user use the entire     cluster. This means that each user can only use a part of the     cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whether or not you are a member of a Virtual Organisation (VO).</p> <p>Each VO gets assigned a fair share target, which has a big impact on the job priority.

This can have a (strong) negative impact on the priority of your jobs compared to the jobs of users who are in a specific VO.</p> <p>See Virtual Organisations for more information on how to join a VO, or request the creation of a new VO if there is none yet for your research group.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Some other factors are how busy the cluster is, how many workernodes are active, the resources (e.g., number of cores, memory) provided by each workernode, ...</p> <p>It might be beneficial to request less resources (e.g., not requesting all cores in a workernode), since the scheduler often finds a \"gap\" to fit the job into more easily.</p> <p>Sometimes it happens that couple of nodes are free and a job would not start. Empty nodes are not necessary empty for your job(s). Just imagine, that an N-node-job (with a higher priority than your waiting job(s)) should run.

There are no guarantees about the time your data will be stored on this system, and we plan to clean these automatically on a regular basis.

We don't guarantee that these policies remain forever, and may change them if this seems necessary for the healthy operation of the cluster.</p> <p>Each type of scratch has its own use:</p> <p>Node scratch ($VSC_SCRATCH_NODE).   Every node has its own scratch space, which is completely separated     from the other nodes. On some clusters, it will be on a local disk     in the node, while on other clusters it will be emulated through     another file server. Some drawbacks are that the storage can only be accessed on that     particular node and that the capacity is often very limited (e.g.,     100 GB). The performance will depend a lot on the particular     implementation in the cluster. In many cases, it will be     significantly slower than the cluster scratch as it typically     consists of just a single disk. However, if that disk is local to     the node (as on most clusters), the performance will not depend on     what others are doing on the cluster.</p> <p>Cluster scratch ($VSC_SCRATCH).  To allow a job running on multiple nodes (or multiple jobs running     on separate nodes) to share data as files, every node of the cluster     (including the login nodes) has access to this shared scratch     directory. Just like the home and data directories, every user has     its own scratch directory.

There are various factors that determine to what extent these extra resources can be used and how efficiently they can be used.  More information on this in the subsections below.</p>"}, {"location": "troubleshooting/#using-multiple-cores", "title": "Using multiple cores", "text": "<p>When you want to speed up your jobs by requesting multiple cores, you also need to use software that is actually capable of  using them (and use them efficiently, ideally). Unless a particular parallel programming paradigm like OpenMP threading  (shared memory) or MPI (distributed memory) is used,  software will run sequentially (on a single core).</p> <p>To use multiple cores, the software needs to be able to create, manage, and synchronize multiple threads or processes.  More on how to implement parallelization for you exact programming language can be found online. Note that when using software that only uses threads to use multiple cores, there is no point in asking for multiple nodes,  since with a multi-threading (shared memory) approach you can only use the resources (cores, memory) of a single node.</p> <p>Even if your software is able to use multiple cores, maybe there is no point in going beyond a single core or a handful of cores,  for example because the workload you are running is too small or does not parallelize well. You can test this by increasing the amount of cores step-wise, and look at the speedup you gain. For example,  test with 2, 4, 16, a quarter of, half of, and all available cores.</p> <p>Other reasons why using more cores may not lead to a (significant) speedup include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Overhead: When you use multi-threading (OpenMP) or multi-processing (MPI),  you should not expect that doubling the amount of cores will result in a 2x speedup.  This is due to the fact that time is needed to create, manage and synchronize the threads/processes. When this \"bookkeeping\" overhead exceeds the time gained by parallelization, you will not observe any speedup (or even see slower runs). For example, this can happen when you split your program in too many (tiny) tasks to run in parallel -  creating a thread/process for each task may even take longer than actually running the task itself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Amdahl's Law is often used in parallel computing to predict the maximum achievable (theoretical) speedup when using multiple cores.  It states that \"the overall performance improvement gained by optimizing a single part of a system is limited by the fraction of time that the improved part is actually used\".  For example, if a program needs 20 hours to complete using a single core, but a one-hour portion of the program can not be parallelized,  only the remaining 19 hours of execution time can be sped up using parallelization.  Regardless of how many cores are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time is always more than 1 hour.  So when you reach this theoretical limit, using more cores will not help at all to speed up the computational workload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource contention: When two or more threads/processes want to access the same resource, they need to wait on each other - this is called resource contention.  As a result, 1 thread/process will need to wait until the other one is finished using that resource.  When each thread uses the same resource, it will definitely run slower than if it doesn't need to wait for other threads to finish.</p> </li> <li> <p>Software limitations: It is possible that the software you are using is just not really optimized for parallelization.  An example of a software that is not really optimized for multi-threading is Python (although this has improved over the years). This is due to the fact that in Python threads are implemented in a way that multiple threads can not run at the same time, due to the global interpreter lock (GIL).  Instead of using multi-threading in Python to speedup a CPU bound program, you should use multi-processing instead,  which uses multiple processes (multiple instances of the same program) instead of multiple threads in a single program instance. Using multiple processes can speed up your CPU bound programs a lot more in Python than threads can do, even though they are much less efficient to create. In other programming languages (which don't have a GIL), you would probably still want to use threads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Affinity and core pinning:  Even when the software you are using is able to efficiently use multiple cores, you may not see any speedup (or even a significant slowdown). This could be due to threads or processes that are not pinned to specific cores and keep hopping around between cores,  or because the pinning is done incorrectly and several threads/processes are being pinned to the same core(s), and thus keep \"fighting\" each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lack of sufficient memory: When there is not enough memory available, or not enough memory bandwidth,  it is likely that you will not see a significant speedup when using more cores (since each thread or process most likely requires additional memory).</p> </li> </ul> <p>More info on running multi-core workloads on the HPC-UGent infrastructure can be found here.</p>"}, {"location": "troubleshooting/#using-multiple-nodes", "title": "Using multiple nodes", "text": "<p>When trying to use multiple (worker)nodes to improve the performance of your workloads, you may not see (significant) speedup.</p> <p>Parallelizing code across nodes is fundamentally different from leveraging multiple cores via multi-threading within a single node. The scalability achieved through multi-threading does not extend seamlessly to distributing computations across multiple nodes. This means that just changing <code>#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=10</code> to <code>#PBS -l nodes=2:ppn=10</code> may only increase the waiting time to get your job running (because twice as many resources are requested), and will not improve the execution time.</p> <p>Actually using additional nodes is not as straightforward as merely asking for multiple nodes when submitting your job. The resources on these additional nodes often need to discovered, managed, and synchronized. This introduces complexities in distributing work effectively across the nodes. Luckily, there exist some libraries that do this for you.</p> <p>Using the resources of multiple nodes is often done using a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. MPI allows nodes to communicate and coordinate, but it also introduces additional complexity.</p> <p>An example of how you can make beneficial use of multiple nodes can be found here.</p> <p>You can also use MPI in Python, some useful packages that are also available on the HPC are:</p> <ul> <li>mpi4py</li> <li>Boost.MPI</li> </ul> <p>We advise to maximize core utilization before considering using multiple nodes. Our infrastructure has clusters with a lot of cores per node so we suggest that you first try to use all the cores on 1 node before you expand to more nodes.

This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.</p> <p>Scripts are basically non-compiled pieces of code: they are just text files. Since they don't contain machine code, they are executed by what is called a \"parser\" or an \"interpreter\". This is another program that understands the command in the script, and converts them to machine code. There are many kinds of scripting languages, including Perl and Python.</p> <p>Another very common scripting language is shell scripting. In a shell script, you will put the commands you would normally type at your shell prompt in the same order. This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.</p> <p>Typically in the following examples they'll have on each line the next command to be executed although it is possible to put multiple commands on one line. A very simple example of a script may be:</p> <pre><code>echo \"Hello! This is my hostname:\" \nhostname\n</code></pre> <p>You can type both lines at your shell prompt, and the result will be the following:</p> <pre><code>$ echo \"Hello! This is my hostname:\"\nHello! This is my hostname:\n$ hostname\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>Suppose we want to call this script \"foo\". You open a new file for editing, and name it \"foo\", and edit it with your favourite editor</p> <pre><code>nano foo\n</code></pre> <p>or use the following commands:</p> <pre><code>echo \"echo 'Hello! This is my hostname:'\" &gt; foo\necho hostname &gt;&gt; foo\n</code></pre> <p>The easiest ways to run a script is by starting the interpreter and pass the script as parameter. In case of our script, the interpreter may either be \"sh\" or \"bash\" (which are the same on the cluster). So start the script:</p> <pre><code>$ bash foo\nHello! This is my hostname:\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>Congratulations, you just created and started your first shell script!</p> <p>A more advanced way of executing your shell scripts is by making them executable by their own, so without invoking the interpreter manually. The system can not automatically detect which interpreter you want, so you need to tell this in some way. The easiest way is by using the so called \"shebang\" notation, explicitly created for this function: you put the following line on top of your shell script \"#!/path/to/your/interpreter\".</p> <p>You can find this path with the \"which\" command. In our case, since we use bash as an interpreter, we get the following path:</p> <pre><code>$ which bash\n/bin/bash\n</code></pre> <p>We edit our script and change it with this information:</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hello! This is my hostname:\"\nhostname\n</code></pre> <p>Note that the \"shebang\" must be the first line of your script! Now the operating system knows which program should be started to run the script.</p> <p>Finally, we tell the operating system that this script is now executable. For this we change its file attributes:</p> <pre><code>chmod +x foo\n</code></pre> <p>Now you can start your script by simply executing it:</p> <pre><code>$ ./foo\nHello! This is my hostname:\ngligar07.gastly.os\n</code></pre> <p>The same technique can be used for all other scripting languages, like Perl and Python.</p> <p>Most scripting languages understand that lines beginning with \"#\" are comments, and should be ignored.

It's famous for its \"delta-transfer algorithm\", which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by only sending the differences between files.</p> <p>You will need to run <code>rsync</code> from a computer where it is installed. Installing <code>rsync</code> is the easiest on Linux: it comes pre-installed with a lot of distributions.</p> <p>For example, to copy a folder with lots of CSV files: <pre><code>$ rsync -rzv testfolder vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:data/\n</code></pre></p> <p>will copy the folder <code>testfolder</code> and its contents to <code>$VSC_DATA</code> on the , assuming the <code>data</code> symlink is present in your home directory, see  symlinks section.</p> <p>The <code>-r</code> flag means \"recursively\", the <code>-z</code> flag means that compression is enabled (this is especially handy when dealing with CSV files because they compress well) and the <code>-v</code> enables more verbosity (more details about what's going on).</p> <p>To copy large files using <code>rsync</code>, you can use the <code>-P</code> flag: it enables both showing of progress and resuming partially downloaded files.</p> <p>To copy files to your local computer, you can also use <code>rsync</code>: <pre><code>$ rsync -rzv vsc40000@login.hpc.ugent.be:data/bioset local_folder\n</code></pre> This will copy the folder <code>bioset</code> and its contents on <code>$VSC_DATA</code> to a local folder
