with its own implementation of OpenSSH, so you don't need to install any
third-party software to use it. Just open a terminal window and jump in!</p>
<p>On all popular <abbr title="An operating system, similar to UNIX.">Linux</abbr> distributions, the OpenSSH software is readily
available, and most often installed by default. You can check whether
the OpenSSH software is installed by opening a terminal and typing:</p>
<pre><code><b>$ ssh -V</b>

</code></pre>

<p>To access the clusters and transfer your files, you will use the

<p>A key pair might already be present in the default location inside your
home directory. Therefore, we first check if a key is available with the
"list short" ("ls") command:</p>
<pre><code><b>$ ls ~/.ssh</b>
</code></pre>

<p>If a key-pair is already available, you would normally get:</p>
<pre><code>authorized_keys     id_rsa      id_rsa.pub      known_hosts
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the command will show:</p>
<pre><code>ls: .ssh: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>You can recognise a public/private key pair when a pair of files has the
same name except for the extension ".pub" added to one of them. In this
particular case, the private key is "id_rsa" and public key is
"id_rsa.pub". You may have multiple keys (not necessarily in the
directory "~/.ssh") if you or your operating system requires this. Be
aware that your existing key pair might be too short, or not the right
type.</p>
<p>You will need to generate a new key pair, when:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>you don't have a key pair yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you forgot the passphrase protecting your private key</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or your private key was compromised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your key pair is too short or not the right type</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For extra security, the private key itself can be encrypted using a
"passphrase", to prevent anyone from using your private key even when
they manage to copy it. You have to "unlock" the private key by typing
the passphrase. Be sure to never give away your private key, it is
private and should stay private. You should not even copy it to one of
your other machines, instead, you should create a new public/private key
pair for each machine.</p>
<pre><code><b>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</b>
Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the
key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no
passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been
saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in
/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
</code></pre>

<p>This will ask you for a file name to store the private and public key,
and a passphrase to protect your private key. It needs to be emphasised
that you really should choose the passphrase wisely! The system will ask
you for it every time you want to use the private key that is every time
you want to access the <abbr title="A group of compute nodes.">cluster</abbr> or transfer your files.</p>
