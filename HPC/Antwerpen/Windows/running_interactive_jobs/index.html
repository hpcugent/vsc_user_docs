<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Interactive jobs are jobs which give you an interactive session on one
of the compute nodes. Importantly, accessing the compute nodes this way
means that the job control system guarantees the resources that you have
asked for.</p>
<p>Interactive PBS jobs are similar to non-interactive PBS jobs in that
they are submitted to PBS via the command <strong>qsub</strong>. Where an interactive job
differs is that it does not require a job script, the required PBS
directives can be specified on the command line.</p>
<p>Interactive jobs can be useful to debug certain job scripts or programs,
but should not be the main use of the UAntwerpen-<abbr title="High Performance Computing, high performance computing and multiple-task computing on a supercomputer.">HPC</abbr>. Waiting for user input takes a
very long time in the life of a <abbr title="A central processing unit. A CPU is a consumable resource. A compute node typically contains one or more CPUs">CPU</abbr> and does not make efficient usage of
the computing resources.</p>
<p>The syntax for <em>qsub</em> for submitting an interactive PBS job is:</p>
<pre><code><b>$ qsub -I <... pbs directives ...></b>
</code></pre>

<p>In this last example, we will show you that you can just work on this
<abbr title="The computational units on which batch or interactive jobs are processed. A compute node is pretty much comparable to a single personal computer. It contains one or more sockets, each holding a single CPU. Some nodes also contain one or more GPGPUs. The compute node is equipped with memory (RAM) that is accessible by all its CPUs.">compute node</abbr>, just as if you were working locally on your desktop. We
will run the Fibonacci example of the previous chapter again, but now in
full interactive mode in MATLAB.</p>

<p>And start the MATLAB interactive environment:</p>

<p>And start the fibo2.m program in the command window:</p>
<p>::: prompt
